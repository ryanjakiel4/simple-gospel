I am dark but lovely, O maidens of Jerusalem,dark like the tents of Qedar, lovely like the tent curtains of Salmah.

Tell me, O you whom my heart loves,where do you pasture your sheep?Where do you rest your sheep during the midday heat?Tell me lest I wander around beside the flocks of your companions!

 [The Lover to His Beloved:]
My lover spoke to me, saying:“Arise, my darling;My beautiful one, come away with me!
[poetry]

 Look! The winter has passed,the winter rains are over and gone.

 Blossoms have appeared in the land;the time for pruning and singing has come;the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
[poetry]
[13]
 The fig tree has ripened its figs;the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance.Arise, come away my darling;my beautiful one, come away with me!”

All night long on my bed I longed for my lover. I longed for him, but he never appeared.

 The night watchmen found me—the ones who guard the city walls. “Have you seen my beloved?”

 [The Beloved to the Maidens:]
 I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem,by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields:“Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!”

 Who is this coming up from the wildernesslike a column of smoke,like a fragrant billow of myrrh and frankincense, every kind of fragrant powder of the traveling merchants?
[poetry]
[7]
 Look! It is Solomon’s portable couch! It is surrounded by sixty warriors,some of Israel’s mightiest warriors.
[poetry]
[8]
 All of them are skilled with a sword, well trained in the art of warfare. Each has his sword at his side,to guard against the terrors of the night.
[poetry]
[9]
 King Solomon made a sedan chair for himselfof wood imported from Lebanon.
[poetry]
[10]
 Its posts were made of silver; its back was made of gold.Its seat was upholstered with purple wool; its interior was inlaid with leather by the maidens of Jerusalem.
[poetry]

 Come out, O maidens of Zion,and gaze upon King Solomon!He is wearing the crown with which his mother crowned himon his wedding day,on the most joyous day of his life!

 Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheepcoming up from the washing place; each of them has a twin,and not one of them is missing.
[poetry]
[3]
 Your lips are like a scarlet thread; your mouth is lovely.Your forehead behind your veilis like a slice of pomegranate.

 You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride!You have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.

 How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!How much better is your love than wine;the fragrance of your perfume is better than any spice!

 Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride;honey and milk are under your tongue.The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
[poetry]

You are a locked garden, my sister, my bride;you are an enclosed spring, a sealed-up fountain.

 Your shoots are a royal garden full of pomegranateswith choice fruits:henna with nard,
[poetry]
[14]
 nard and saffron,calamus and cinnamon with every kind of spice,myrrh and aloes with all the finest spices.
[poetry]

 You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water flowing down from Lebanon.

I was asleep, but my mind was dreaming. Listen! My lover is knocking at the door! [The Lover to His Beloved:]

 My lover thrust his hand through the hole, and my feelings were stirred for him.
[poetry]
[5]
 I arose to open for my beloved;my hands dripped with myrrh—my fingers flowed with myrrhon the handles of the lock.
[poetry]
[6]
 I opened for my beloved,but my lover had already turned and gone away. I fell into despair when he departed. I looked for him but did not find him;I called him, but he did not answer me.
[poetry]

 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city.They beat me; they bruised me;they took away my cloak, those watchmen on the walls!

 [The Beloved to Her Lover:]
Oh, how I wish you were my little brother, nursing at my mother’s breasts;if I saw you outside, I could kiss you—surely no one would despise me!

Who is this coming up from the wilderness,leaning on her beloved?[The Beloved to Her Lover:]
Under the apple tree I aroused you; there your mother conceived you;there she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.
[poetry]

 [The Beloved to Her Lover:]
Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart, like a signet on your arm. For love is as strong as death; passion is as unrelenting as Sheol.Its flames burst forth; it is a blazing flame.

 Surging waters cannot quench love;floodwaters cannot overflow it.If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love, the offer would be utterly despised.

We have a little sister,and as yet she has no breasts.What shall we do for our sisteron the day when she is spoken for?

 My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal alone. The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon,and 200 shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.
[poetry]
[13]
 [The Lover to His Beloved:]
O you who stay in the gardens,my companions are listening attentively for your voice;let me be the one to hear it!
[poetry]
[14]
 [The Beloved to Her Lover:]
Make haste, my beloved!Be like a gazelle or a young stagon the mountains of spices.
