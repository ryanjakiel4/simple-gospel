Proverbs Text

Chapter 1
[poetry]

[1:1]
 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
[poetry]

[2]
 To learn wisdom and moral instruction, to discern wise counsel.
[poetry]

[3]
 To receive moral instruction in skillful living, with righteousness, justice, and equity.
[poetry]

[4]
 To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, a discerning plan to the young person.
[poetry]

[5]
 (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance!)
[poetry]

[6]
 To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.
[poetry]

[7]
 Fearing the Lord is the beginning of discernment, but fools have despised wisdom and moral instruction.
[poetry]

[8]
 Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.
[poetry]

[9]
 For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,and like pendants around your neck.
[poetry]

[10]
 My child, if sinners try to entice you,do not consent!
[poetry]

[11]
 If they say, “Come with us!We will lie in wait to shed blood; we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.
[poetry]

[12]
 We will swallow them alive like Sheol, those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.
[poetry]

[13]
 We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;we will fill our houses with plunder.
[poetry]

[14]
 Join with us! We will all share equally in what we steal.”
[poetry]

[15]
 My child, do not go down their way, withhold yourself from their path;
[poetry]

[16]
 for they are eager to inflict harm, and they hasten to shed blood.
[poetry]

[17]
 Surely it is futile to spread a netin plain sight of any bird,
[poetry]

[18]
 but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives!
[poetry]

[19]
 Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; it takes away the life of those who obtain it!
[poetry]

[20]
 Wisdom calls out in the street, she shouts loudly in the plazas;
[poetry]

[21]
 at the head of the noisy streets she calls,in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:
[poetry]

[22]
 “How long will you simpletons love naiveté? How long have mockers delighted in mockery? And how long will fools hate knowledge?
[poetry]

[23]
 You should respond to my rebuke. Then I would pour out my thoughts to you;I would make my words known to you.
[poetry]

[24]
 However, because I called but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention,
[poetry]

[25]
 and you neglected all my advice,and did not comply with my rebuke,
[poetry]

[26]
 so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when what you dread comes,
[poetry]

[27]
 when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, when distressing trouble comes on you.
[poetry]

[28]
 Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.
[poetry]

[29]
 Because they hated moral knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord,
[poetry]

[30]
 they did not comply with my advice;they spurned all my rebuke.
[poetry]

[31]
 Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way, and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.
[poetry]

[32]
 For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them, and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.
[poetry]

[33]
 But the one who listens to me will live in security and will be at ease from the dread of harm.”

Chapter 2
[poetry]

[2:1]
 My child, if you receive my words,and store up my commands inside yourself,
[poetry]

[2]
 by making your ear attentive to wisdom and by turning your heart to understanding,
[poetry]

[3]
 indeed, if you call out for discernment—shout loudly for understanding—
[poetry]

[4]
 if you seek it like silver and search for it like hidden treasure,
[poetry]

[5]
 then you will understand how to fear the Lord, and you will discover knowledge about God.
[poetry]

[6]
 For the Lord gives wisdom,and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
[poetry]

[7]
 He stores up effective counsel for the upright and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,
[poetry]

[8]
 to guard the paths of the righteous and to protect the way of his pious ones.
[poetry]

[9]
 Then you will understand righteousness and justiceand equity—every good way.
[poetry]

[10]
 For wisdom will enter your heart, and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.
[poetry]

[11]
 Discretion will protect you; understanding will guard you
[poetry]

[12]
 to deliver you from the way of the wicked, from those speaking perversity,
[poetry]

[13]
 who leave the upright pathsto walk on the dark ways,
[poetry]

[14]
 who delight in doing evil; they rejoice in perverse evil,
[poetry]

[15]
 whose paths are morally crooked and who are devious in their ways,
[poetry]

[16]
 to deliver you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words,
[poetry]

[17]
 who leaves the husband from her younger days and has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.
[poetry]

[18]
 For she has set her house by death and her paths by the place of the departed spirits.
[poetry]

[19]
 None who go in to her will return, nor will they reach the paths of life.
[poetry]

[20]
 So you will walk in the way of good people and will keep on the paths of the righteous.
[poetry]

[21]
 For the upright will reside in the land,and those with integrity will remain in it,
[poetry]

[22]
 but the wicked will be removed from the land,and the treacherous will be torn away from it.

[poetry]

[2]

[poetry]

[3]
 Do not let mercy and truth leave you;bind them around your neck,write them on the tablet of your heart.
[poetry]

[4]
 Then you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and people.
[poetry]

[5]
 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.
[poetry]

 Honor the Lord from your wealthand from the firstfruits of all your crops;
[poetry]

[10]
 then your barns will be filled completely, and your vats will overflow with new wine.
[poetry]

[11]
 My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord, and do not loathe his rebuke.
[poetry]

[12]
 For the Lord disciplines those he loves,just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.
[poetry]

[13]
 Blessed is the one who has found wisdomand the one who obtains understanding.
[poetry]

[14]
 For her benefit is more profitable than silver,and her gain is better than gold.
[poetry]

[15]
 She is more precious than rubies,and none of the things you desire can compare with her.
[poetry]

[16]
 Long life is in her right hand;in her left hand are riches and honor.
[poetry]

[17]
 Her ways are very pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.
[poetry]

[18]
 She is like a tree of life to those who grasp onto her, and everyone who takes hold of her will be blessed.
[poetry]

[19]
 By wisdom the Lord laid the foundation of the earth; he established the heavens by understanding.
[poetry]

[20]
 By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open, so that the clouds drip down dew.
[poetry]

[21]
 My child, do not let them escape from your sight;safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
[poetry]

[22]
 So they will become life for your soul and grace around your neck.
[poetry]

[23]
 Then you will walk on your way with security,and you will not stumble.
[poetry]

[24]
 When you lie down you will not be filled with fear; when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
[poetry]

[25]
 Do not be afraid of sudden disaster or when destruction overtakes the wicked;
[poetry]

 for the Lord will be the source of your confidence, and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.
[poetry]

[poetry]

[4:1]
 Listen, children, to a father’s instruction, and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.
[poetry]

[2]
 Because I hereby give you good instruction,do not forsake my teaching.
[poetry]

[3]
 When I was a son to my father, a tender, only child before my mother,
[poetry]

[4]
 he taught me, and he said to me:“Let your heart lay hold of my words;keep my commands so that you will live.
[poetry]

[5]
 Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.
[poetry]

[6]
 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;love her, and she will guard you.
[poetry]

[7]
 Wisdom is supreme—so acquire wisdom,and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!
[poetry]

[8]
 Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;she will honor you if you embrace her.
[poetry]

[9]
 She will place a fair garland on your head;she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”
[poetry]

[10]
 Listen, my child, and accept my wordsso that the years of your life will be many.
[poetry]

[11]
 I hereby guide you in the way of wisdom,and I lead you in upright paths.
[poetry]

[12]
 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered, and when you run, you will not stumble.
[poetry]

[13]
 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;protect it, because it is your life.
[poetry]

[14]
 Do not enter the path of the wickedor walk in the way of those who are evil.
[poetry]

[15]
 Avoid it, do not go on it;turn away from it, and go on.
[poetry]

[16]
 For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm; they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble.
[poetry]

[17]
 Indeed they have eaten bread gained from wickedness and drink wine obtained from violence.
[poetry]

[18]
 But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light, growing brighter and brighter until full day.
[poetry]

[19]
 The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;they do not know what they stumble over.
[poetry]

[20]
 My child, pay attention to my words;listen attentively to my sayings.
[poetry]

[21]
 Do not let them depart from your sight;guard them within your heart,
[poetry]

[22]
 for they are life to those who find them and healing to one’s entire body.
[poetry]

[23]
 Guard your heart with all vigilance, for from it are the sources of life.
[poetry]

[24]
 Remove perverse speech from your mouth; keep devious talk far from your lips.
[poetry]

[25]
 Let your eyes look directly in front of you,and let your gaze look straight before you.
[poetry]

[26]
 Make the path for your feet level, so that all your ways may be established.
[poetry]

[27]
 Do not turn to the right or to the left;turn yourself away from evil.

Chapter 5
[poetry]

[5:1]
 My child, be attentive to my wisdom;pay close attention to my understanding,
[poetry]

[2]
 in order to safeguard discretion and that your lips may guard knowledge.
[poetry]

[3]
 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,
[poetry]

[4]
 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
[poetry]

[5]
 Her feet go down to death;her steps lead straight to the grave.
[poetry]

[6]
 Lest she should make level the path leading to life, her paths have wandered, but she is not able to discern it.
[poetry]

[7]
 So now, children, listen to me;do not turn aside from the words I speak.
[poetry]

[8]
 Keep yourself far from her,and do not go near the door of her house,
[poetry]

[9]
 lest you give your vigor to others and your years to a cruel person,
[poetry]

[10]
 lest strangers devour your strength and your labor benefit another man’s house.
[poetry]

[11]
 And at the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are wasted away.
[poetry]

[12]
 And you will say, “How I hated discipline!My heart spurned reproof!
[poetry]

[13]
 For I did not obey my teachers, and I did not heed my instructors.
[poetry]

[14]
 I almost came to complete ruin in the midst of the whole congregation!”
[poetry]

[15]
 Drink water from your own cisternand running water from your own well.
[poetry]

[16]
 Should your springs be dispersed outside,your streams of water in the wide plazas?
[poetry]

[17]
 Let them be for yourself aloneand not for strangers with you.
[poetry]

[18]
 May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife you married in your youth—
[poetry]

[19]
 a loving doe, a graceful deer;may her breasts satisfy you at all times;may you be captivated by her love always.
[poetry]

[20]
 But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,and embrace the bosom of a different woman?
[poetry]

[21]
 For the ways of a person are in front of the Lord’s eyes,and the Lord weighs all that person’s paths.
[poetry]

[22]
 The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities, and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.
[poetry]

[23]
 He will die because there was no discipline;because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.

Chapter 6
[poetry]

[6:1]
 My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor, if you have become a guarantor for a stranger,
[poetry]

[2]
 if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
[poetry]

[3]
 then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself, because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power: Go, humble yourself, and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
[poetry]

[4]
 Permit no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
[poetry]

[5]
 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.
[poetry]

[6]
 Go to the ant, you sluggard; observe her ways and be wise!
[poetry]

[7]
 It has no commander, overseer, or ruler,
[poetry]

[8]
 yet it would prepare its food in the summer;it gathered at the harvest what it will eat.
[poetry]

[9]
 How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?When will you rise from your sleep?
[poetry]

[10]
 A little sleep, a little slumber,a little folding of the hands to relax,
[poetry]

[11]
 and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need like an armed man.
[poetry]

[12]
 A worthless and wicked person walks around saying perverse things;
[poetry]

[13]
 he winks with his eyes,signals with his feet,and points with his fingers;
[poetry]

[14]
 he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart;he spreads contention at all times.
[poetry]

[15]
 Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
[poetry]

[16]
 There are six things that the Lord hates,even seven things that are an abomination to him:
[poetry]

[17]
 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
[poetry]

[18]
 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that are swift to run to evil,
[poetry]

[19]
 a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who spreads discord among family members.
[poetry]

[20]
 My child, guard the commands of your fatherand do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
[poetry]

[21]
 Bind them on your heart continually;fasten them around your neck.
[poetry]

[22]
 When you walk about, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you;when you wake up, they will talk to you.
[poetry]

[23]
 For the commandments are like a lamp; instruction is like a light,and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life
[poetry]

[24]
 by keeping you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
[poetry]

[25]
 Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
[poetry]

[26]
 for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
[poetry]

[27]
 Can a man hold fire against his chest without burning his clothes?
[poetry]

[28]
 Can a man walk on hot coalswithout scorching his feet?
[poetry]

[29]
 So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife;no one who touches her will escape punishment.
[poetry]

[30]
 People do not despise a thief when he stealsto fulfill his need when he is hungry.
[poetry]

[31]
 Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over;he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
[poetry]

[32]
 A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; whoever does it destroys his own life.
[poetry]

[33]
 He will be beaten and despised, and his reproach will not be wiped away;
[poetry]

[34]
 for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
[poetry]

[35]
 He will not consider any compensation; he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.

Chapter 7
[poetry]

[7:1]
 My child, devote yourself to my wordsand store up my commands inside yourself.
[poetry]

[2]
 Keep my commands so that you may live, and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.
[poetry]

[3]
 Bind them on your forearm; write them on the tablet of your heart.
[poetry]

[4]
 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding a close relative
[poetry]

[5]
 so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words.
[poetry]

[6]
 For at the window of my housethrough my window lattice I looked out,
[poetry]

[7]
 and I saw among the naive—I discerned among the youths—a young man who lacked sense.
[poetry]

[8]
 He was passing by the street near her corner,making his way along the road to her house
[poetry]

[9]
 in the twilight, the evening, in the dark of the night.
[poetry]

[10]
 Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent.
[poetry]

[11]
 (She is loud and rebellious;she does not remain at home—
[poetry]

[12]
 at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,and by every corner she lies in wait.)
[poetry]

[13]
 So she grabbed him and kissed him,and with a bold expression she said to him,
[poetry]

[14]
 “I have meat from my peace offerings at home; today I have fulfilled my vows!
[poetry]

[15]
 That is why I came out to meet you,to look for you, and I found you!
[poetry]

[16]
 I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, with richly colored fabric from Egypt.
[poetry]

[17]
 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
[poetry]

[18]
 Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning;let’s delight ourselves with love’s pleasures.
[poetry]

[19]
 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a journey of some distance.
[poetry]

[20]
 He has taken a bag of money with him; he will not return until the end of the month.”
[poetry]

[21]
 She turned him aside with her persuasions; with her smooth talk she was enticing him along.
[poetry]

[22]
 Suddenly he was going after herlike an ox that goes to the slaughter,like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare
[poetry]

[23]
 till an arrow pierces his liver—like a bird hurrying into a trap,and he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[poetry]

[24]
 So now, sons, listen to me,and pay attention to the words I speak.
[poetry]

[25]
 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways—do not wander into her pathways;
[poetry]

[26]
 for she has brought down many fatally wounded,and all those she has slain are many.
[poetry]

[27]
 Her house is the way to the grave, going down to the chambers of death.

Chapter 8
[poetry]

[8:1]
 Does not wisdom call out?Does not understanding raise her voice?
[poetry]

[2]
 At the top of the prominent places along the way,at the intersection of the paths she has taken her stand;
[poetry]

[3]
 beside the gates opening into the city,at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:
[poetry]

[4]
 “To you, O people, I call out,and my voice calls to all mankind.
[poetry]

[5]
 You who are naive, discern wisdom!And you fools, understand discernment!
[poetry]

[6]
 Listen, for I will speak excellent things, and my lips will utter what is right.
[poetry]

[7]
 For my mouth speaks truth, and my lips hate wickedness.
[poetry]

[8]
 All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.
[poetry]

[9]
 All of them are clear to the discerningand upright to those who find knowledge.
[poetry]

[10]
 Receive my instruction rather than silver,and knowledge rather than choice gold.
[poetry]

[11]
 For wisdom is better than rubies,and desirable things cannot be compared to her.
[poetry]

[12]
 “I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
[poetry]

[13]
 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;I hate arrogant pride and the evil wayand perverse utterances.
[poetry]

[14]
 Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me; I possess understanding and might.
[poetry]

[15]
 By me, kings reign,and by me, potentates decree righteousness;
[poetry]

[16]
 by me, princes rule,as well as nobles and all righteous judges.
[poetry]

[17]
 I will love those who love me,and those who seek me diligently will find me.
[poetry]

[18]
 Riches and honor are with me,long-lasting wealth and righteousness.
[poetry]

[19]
 My fruit is better than the purest gold, and my harvest is better than choice silver.
[poetry]

[20]
 I walk in the path of righteousness,in the pathway of justice,
[poetry]

[21]
 that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,and that I may fill their treasuries.
[poetry]

[22]
 The Lord created me as the beginning of his works, before his deeds of long ago.
[poetry]

[23]
 From eternity I have been fashioned, from the beginning, from before the world existed.
[poetry]

[24]
 When there were no deep oceans I was born, when there were no springs overflowing with water;
[poetry]

[25]
 before the mountains were set in place—before the hills—I was born,
[poetry]

[26]
 before he made the earth and its fields, or the top soil of the world.
[poetry]

[27]
 When he established the heavens, I was there;when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,
[poetry]

[28]
 when he established the clouds above,when he secured the fountains of the deep,
[poetry]

[29]
 when he gave the sea his decree that the waters should not pass over his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
[poetry]

[30]
 then I was beside him as a master craftsman, and I was his delight day by day,rejoicing before him at all times,
[poetry]

[31]
 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and delighting in its people.
[poetry]

[32]
 “So now, children, listen to me;blessed are those who keep my ways.
[poetry]

[33]
 Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise, and do not neglect it.
[poetry]

[34]
 Blessed is the one who listens to me,watching at my doors day by day,waiting beside my doorway.
[poetry]

[35]
 For the one who finds me has found lifeand received favor from the Lord.
[poetry]

[36]
 But the one who misses me brings harm to himself; all who hate me love death.”

Chapter 9
[poetry]

[9:1]
 Wisdom has built her house;she has carved out its seven pillars.
[poetry]

[2]
 She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;she also has arranged her table.
[poetry]

[3]
 She has sent out her female servants;she calls out on the highest places of the city.
[poetry]

[4]
 “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here.”To those who lack understanding, she has said,
[poetry]

[5]
 “Come, eat some of my food,and drink some of the wine I have mixed.
[poetry]

[6]
 Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live, and proceed in the way of understanding.”
[poetry]

[7]
 Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult; whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse.
[poetry]

[8]
 Do not reprove a mocker, or he will hate you;reprove a wise person, and he will love you.
[poetry]

[9]
 Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still;teach a righteous person, and he will add to his learning.
[poetry]

[10]
 The beginning of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.
[poetry]

[11]
 For because of me your days will be many,and years will be added to your life.
[poetry]

[12]
 If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage, but if you have mocked, you alone must bear it.
[poetry]

[13]
 The woman called Folly is brash; she is naive and does not know anything.
[poetry]

[14]
 And she has sat down at the door of her house,on a seat at the highest point of the city,
[poetry]

[15]
 calling out to those who are passing by her in the way, who go straight on their way.
[poetry]

[16]
 “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,”To those who lack understanding she has said,
[poetry]

[17]
 “Stolen waters are sweet,and food obtained in secret is pleasant!”
[poetry]

[18]
 But they do not realize that the dead are there,that her guests are in the depths of the grave.
