Isaiah Text

Chapter 1
[bodytext]

[1:1]
 Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah reigned over Judah.
[poetry]

[2]
 Listen, O heavens,pay attention, O earth! For the Lord speaks:“I raised children, I brought them up, but they have rebelled against me!
[poetry]

[3]
 An ox recognizes its owner,a donkey recognizes where its owner puts its food; but Israel does not recognize me, my people do not understand.”
[poetry]

[4]
  Beware sinful nation, the people weighed down by evil deeds.They are offspring who do wrong,children who do wicked things.They have abandoned the Lord,and rejected the Holy One of Israel. They are alienated from him.
[poetry]

[5]
  Why do you insist on being battered?Why do you continue to rebel? Your head has a massive wound, your whole heart is sick.
[poetry]

[6]
 From the soles of your feet to your head,there is no spot that is unharmed. There are only bruises, cuts,and open wounds.They have not been cleansed or bandaged,nor have they been treated with olive oil.
[poetry]

[7]
 Your land is devastated,your cities burned with fire.Right before your eyes your cropsare being destroyed by foreign invaders. They leave behind devastation and destruction.
[poetry]

[8]
 Daughter Zion is left isolated,like a hut in a vineyardor a shelter in a cucumber field;she is a besieged city.
[poetry]

[9]
 If the Lord of Heaven’s Armies had not left us a few survivors,we would have quickly been like Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah.
[poetry]

[10]
 Listen to the Lord’s message,you leaders of Sodom! Pay attention to our God’s rebuke, people of Gomorrah!
[poetry]

[11]
 “Of what importance to me are your many sacrifices?” says the Lord.“I have had my fill of burnt sacrifices,of rams and the fat from steers.The blood of bulls, lambs, and goatsI do not want.
[poetry]

[12]
 When you enter my presence,do you actually think I want this—animals trampling on my courtyards?
[poetry]

[13]
 Do not bring any more meaningless offerings;I consider your incense detestable! You observe new moon festivals, Sabbaths, and convocations,but I cannot tolerate sin-stained celebrations!
[poetry]

[14]
 I hate your new moon festivals and assemblies;they are a burdenthat I am tired of carrying.
[poetry]

[15]
 When you spread out your hands in prayer,I look the other way; when you offer your many prayers,I do not listenbecause your hands are covered with blood.
[poetry]

[16]
  Wash! Cleanse yourselves!Remove your sinful deeds from my sight.Stop sinning.
[poetry]

[17]
 Learn to do what is right.Promote justice.Give the oppressed reason to celebrate. Take up the cause of the orphan.Defend the rights of the widow.
[poetry]

[18]
  “Come, let’s consider your options,” says the Lord.“Though your sins have stained you like the color red,you can become white like snow;though they are as easy to see as the color scarlet,you can become white like wool.
[poetry]

[19]
 If you have a willing attitude and obey, then you will again eat the good crops of the land.
[poetry]

[20]
 But if you refuse and rebel,you will be devoured by the sword.”Know for certain that the Lord has spoken.
[poetry]

[21]
 How tragic that the once-faithful cityhas become a prostitute! She was once a center of justice;fairness resided in her—but now only murderers!
[poetry]

[22]
 Your silver has become scum, your beer is diluted with water.
[poetry]

[23]
 Your officials are rebels, they associate with thieves.All of them love bribery,and look for payoffs. They do not take up the cause of the orphan or defend the rights of the widow.
[poetry]

[24]
 Therefore, the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the Powerful One of Israel, says this:“Ah, I will seek vengeance against my adversaries,I will take revenge against my enemies.
[poetry]

[25]
 I will attack you; I will purify your metal with flux. I will remove all your slag.
[poetry]

[26]
 I will reestablish honest judges as in former times,wise advisers as in earlier days. Then you will be called, ‘The Just City,Faithful Town.’”
[poetry]

[27]
  Zion will be freed by justice and her returnees by righteousness.
[poetry]

[28]
 All rebellious sinners will be shattered, those who abandon the Lord will perish.
[poetry]

[29]
 Indeed, they will be ashamed of the sacred treesyou find so desirable;you will be embarrassed because of the sacred orchards where you choose to worship.
[poetry]

[30]
 For you will be like a tree whose leaves wither,like an orchard that is unwatered.
[poetry]

[31]
 The powerful will be like a thread of yarn,their deeds like a spark;both will burn together,and no one will put out the fire.

Chapter 2
[bodytext]

[2:1]
 Here is the message about Judah and Jerusalem that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz.
[poetry]

[2]
 In future days the mountain of the Lord’s temple will endure as the most important of mountainsand will be the most prominent of hills. All the nations will stream to it;
[poetry]

[3]
 many peoples will come and say,“Come, let us go up to the Lord’s mountain,to the temple of the God of Jacob,so he can teach us his requirements, and we can follow his standards.” For Zion will be the center for moral instruction; the Lord’s message will issue from Jerusalem.
[poetry]

[4]
 He will judge disputes between nations;he will settle cases for many peoples.They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not take up the sword against other nations,and they will no longer train for war.
[poetry]

[5]
 O descendants of Jacob,come, let us walk in the Lord’s guiding light.
[poetry]

[6]
 Indeed, O Lord, you have abandoned your people,the descendants of Jacob.For diviners from the east are everywhere; they consult omen readers like the Philistines do. Plenty of foreigners are around.
[poetry]

[7]
 Their land is full of gold and silver;there is no end to their wealth. Their land is full of horses;there is no end to their chariots.
[poetry]

[8]
 Their land is full of worthless idols;they worship the product of their own hands,what their own fingers have fashioned.
[poetry]

[9]
 Men bow down to them in homage,they lie flat on the ground in worship. Don’t spare them!
[poetry]

[10]
 Go up into the rocky cliffs,hide in the ground.Get away from the dreadful judgment of the Lord, from his royal splendor!
[poetry]

[11]
 Proud men will be brought low,arrogant men will be humiliated; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
[poetry]

[12]
 Indeed, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies has planned a day of judgment for all the high and mighty;for all who are proud—they will be humiliated;
[poetry]

[13]
 for all the cedars of Lebanonthat are so high and mighty,for all the oaks of Bashan,
[poetry]

[14]
 for all the tall mountains,for all the high hills,
[poetry]

[15]
 for every high tower,for every fortified wall,
[poetry]

[16]
 for all the large ships, for all the impressive ships.
[poetry]

[17]
 Proud men will be humiliated,arrogant men will be brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
[poetry]

[18]
 The worthless idols will be completely eliminated.
[poetry]

[19]
 They will go into caves in the rocky cliffsand into holes in the ground trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the Lord and his royal splendor,when he rises up to terrify the earth.
[poetry]

[20]
 At that time men will throw their silver and gold idols,which they made for themselves to worship, into the caves where rodents and bats live,
[poetry]

[21]
 so they themselves can go into the crevices of the rocky cliffsand the openings under the rocky overhangs, trying to escape the dreadful judgment of the Lord and his royal splendor,when he rises up to terrify the earth.
[poetry]

[22]
 Stop trusting in human beings,whose life’s breath is in their nostrils.For why should they be given special consideration?

Chapter 3
[poetry]

[3:1]
 Look, the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judahevery source of security, including all the food and water,
[poetry]

[2]
 the mighty men and warriors,judges and prophets,omen readers and leaders,
[poetry]

[3]
 captains of groups of 50,the respected citizens, advisers and those skilled in magical arts, and those who know incantations.
[poetry]

[4]
 The Lord says, “I will make youths their officials;malicious young men will rule over them.
[poetry]

[5]
 The people will treat each other harshly;men will oppose each other;neighbors will fight. Youths will proudly defy the elderlyand riffraff will challenge those who were once respected.
[poetry]

[6]
 Indeed, a man will grab his brotherright in his father’s house and say, ‘You own a coat—you be our leader!This heap of ruins will be under your control.’
[poetry]

[7]
 At that time the brother will shout, ‘I am no doctor, I have no food or coat in my house;don’t make me a leader of the people!’”
[poetry]

[8]
 Jerusalem certainly stumbles,Judah falls,for their words and their actions offend the Lord; they rebel against his royal authority.
[poetry]

[9]
 The look on their faces testifies to their guilt; like the people of Sodom they openly boast of their sin. Woe to them! For they bring disaster on themselves.
[poetry]

[10]
 Tell the innocent it will go well with them, for they will be rewarded for what they have done.
[poetry]

[11]
 Woe to the wicked sinners!For they will get exactly what they deserve.
[poetry]

[12]
 Oppressors treat my people cruelly;creditors rule over them. My people, your leaders mislead you;they give you confusing directions.
[poetry]

[13]
 The Lord takes his position to judge;he stands up to pass sentence on his people.
[poetry]

[14]
 The Lord comes to pronounce judgment on the leaders of his people and their officials.He says, “It is you who have ruined the vineyard! You have stashed in your houses what you have stolen from the poor.
[poetry]

[15]
 Why do you crush my peopleand grind the faces of the poor?” The Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies has spoken.
[poetry]

[16]
 The Lord says,“The women of Zion are proud.They walk with their heads high and flirt with their eyes.They skip along and the jewelry on their ankles jingles.
[poetry]

[17]
 So the Lord will afflict the foreheads of Zion’s women with skin diseases; the Lord will make the front of their heads bald.”
[bodytext]

[18]
At that time the Lord will remove their beautiful ankle jewelry, neck ornaments, crescent-shaped ornaments,
[19]
earrings, bracelets, veils,
[20]
headdresses, ankle ornaments, sashes, sachets, amulets,
[21]
rings, nose rings,
[22]
festive dresses, robes, shawls, purses,
[23]
 garments, vests, head coverings, and gowns.
[poetry]

[24]
 A putrid stench will replace the smell of spices, a rope will replace a belt,baldness will replace braided locks of hair,a sackcloth garment will replace a fine robe,and a prisoner’s brand will replace beauty.
[poetry]

[25]
 Your men will fall by the sword,your strong men will die in battle.
[poetry]

[26]
 Her gates will mourn and lament;deprived of her people, she will sit on the ground.

Chapter 4
[poetry]

[4:1]
 Seven women will grab hold ofone man at that time. They will say, “We will provide our own food,we will provide our own clothes;but let us belong to you—take away our shame!”
[poetry]

[2]
 At that time the crops given by the Lord will bring admiration and honor; the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight to those who remain in Israel.
[poetry]

[3]
 Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem, will be called “holy,” all in Jerusalem who are destined to live.
[poetry]

[4]
 At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion’s women, he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst, as he comes to judgeand to bring devastation.
[poetry]

[5]
 Then the Lord will createover all Mount Zion and over its convocationsa cloud and smoke by dayand a bright flame of fire by night; indeed a canopy will accompany the Lord’s glorious presence.
[poetry]

[6]
 By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.

Chapter 5
[poetry]

[5:1]
 I will sing to my love—a song to my lover about his vineyard. My love had a vineyardon a fertile hill.
[poetry]

[2]
 He built a hedge around it, removed its stones,and planted a vine.He built a tower in the middle of itand constructed a winepress.He waited for it to produce edible grapes,but it produced sour ones instead.
[poetry]

[3]
 So now, residents of Jerusalem, people of Judah,you decide between me and my vineyard!
[poetry]

[4]
 What more can I do for my vineyardbeyond what I have already done?When I waited for it to produce edible grapes,why did it produce sour ones instead?
[poetry]

[5]
 Now I will inform youwhat I am about to do to my vineyard:I will remove its hedge and turn it into pasture, I will break its wall and allow animals to graze there.
[poetry]

[6]
 I will make it a wasteland;no one will prune its vines or hoe its ground, and thorns and briers will grow there.I will order the cloudsnot to drop any rain on it.
[poetry]

[7]
 Indeed, Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,the people of Judah are the cultivated place in which he took delight.He waited for justice, but look what he got—disobedience! He waited for fairness, but look what he got—cries for help!
[poetry]

[8]
 Beware, those who accumulate houses, who also accumulate field after field until there is no land left, and you are the only landowners remaining within the land.
[poetry]

[9]
 The Lord of Heaven’s Armies told me this: “Many houses will certainly become desolate,large, impressive houses will have no one living in them.
[poetry]

[10]
 Indeed, a large vineyard will produce just a few gallons, and enough seed to yield several bushels will produce less than a bushel.”
[poetry]

[11]
 Beware, those who get up early to drink beer, those who keep drinking long after darkuntil they are intoxicated with wine.
[poetry]

[12]
 They have stringed instruments, tambourines, flutes,and wine at their parties.So they do not recognize what the Lord is doing,they do not perceive what he is bringing about.
[poetry]

[13]
 Therefore my people will be deported because of their lack of understanding.Their leaders will have nothing to eat, their masses will have nothing to drink.
[poetry]

[14]
 So Death will open up its throat,and open wide its mouth; Zion’s dignitaries and masses will descend into it,including those who revel and celebrate within her.
[poetry]

[15]
 Men will be humiliated,they will be brought low;the proud will be brought low.
[poetry]

[16]
 The Lord of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted when he punishes, the holy God’s authority will be recognized when he judges.
[poetry]

[17]
 Lambs will graze as if in their pastures,amid the ruins the rich sojourners will graze.
[poetry]

[18]
 Beware, those who pull evil along using cords of emptiness are as good as dead, who pull sin as with cart ropes.
[poetry]

[19]
 They say, “Let him hurry, let him act quickly, so we can see;let the plan of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come to pass,then we will know it!”
[poetry]

[20]
 Beware, those who call evil good and good evil, who turn darkness into light and light into darkness,who turn bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter.
[poetry]

[21]
 Beware, those who think they are wise, those who think they possess understanding.
[poetry]

[22]
 Beware, those who are champions at drinking, who display great courage when mixing strong drinks.
[poetry]

[23]
 They pronounce the guilty innocent for a payoff,they ignore the just cause of the innocent.
[poetry]

[24]
 Therefore, as flaming fire devours strawand dry grass disintegrates in the flames,so their root will rot,and their flower will blow away like dust. For they have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,they have spurned the commands of the Holy One of Israel.
[poetry]

[25]
 So the Lord is furious with his people;he lifts his hand and strikes them.The mountains shake,and corpses lie like manure in the middle of the streets.Despite all this, his anger does not subside,and his hand is ready to strike again.
[poetry]

[26]
 He lifts a signal flag for a distant nation, he whistles for it to come from the far regions of the earth.Look, they come quickly and swiftly.
[poetry]

[27]
 None tire or stumble,they don’t stop to nap or sleep.They don’t loosen their beltsor unstrap their sandals to rest.
[poetry]

[28]
 Their arrows are sharpened,and all their bows are prepared. The hooves of their horses are hard as flint, and their chariot wheels are like a windstorm.
[poetry]

[29]
 Their roar is like a lion’s;they roar like young lions.They growl and seize their prey;they drag it away and no one can come to the rescue.
[poetry]

[30]
 At that time they will growl over their prey, it will sound like sea waves crashing against rocks. One will look out over the land and see the darkness of disaster,clouds will turn the light into darkness.

Chapter 6
[bodytext]

[6:1]
In the year of King Uzziah’s death, I saw the Lord seated on a high, elevated throne. The hem of his robe filled the temple.
[2]
Seraphs stood over him; each one had six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and they used the remaining two to fly.
[3]
They called out to one another, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven’s Armies! His majestic splendor fills the entire earth!”
[4]
 The sound of their voices shook the door frames, and the temple was filled with smoke.
[poetry]

[5]
I said, “Woe to me! I am destroyed, for my lips are contaminated by sin, and I live among people whose lips are contaminated by sin. My eyes have seen the king, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.”
[6]
But then one of the seraphs flew toward me. In his hand was a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.
[7]
He touched my mouth with it and said, “Look, this coal has touched your lips. Your evil is removed; your sin is forgiven.”
[8]
I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom will I send? Who will go on our behalf?” I answered, “Here I am, send me!”
[9]
 He said, “Go and tell these people:“‘Listen continually, but don’t understand.Look continually, but don’t perceive.’
[poetry]

[10]
 Make the hearts of these people calloused;make their ears deaf and their eyes blind.Otherwise they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears,their hearts might understand and they might repent and be healed.”
[poetry]

[11]
 I replied, “How long, Lord?” He said, “Until cities are in ruins and unpopulated,and houses are uninhabited, and the land is ruined and devastated,
[poetry]

[12]
 and the Lord has sent the people off to a distant place,and the very heart of the land is completely abandoned.
[poetry]

[13]
 Even if only a tenth of the people remain in the land, it will again be destroyed, like one of the large sacred trees or an Asherah pole, when a sacred pillar on a high place is thrown down. That sacred pillar symbolizes the special chosen family.”

Chapter 7
[bodytext]

[7:1]
 During the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel marched up to Jerusalem to do battle, but they were unable to prevail against it.
[poetry]

[2]
It was reported to the family of David, “Syria has allied with Ephraim.” They and their people were emotionally shaken, just as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
[3]
So the Lord told Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear Jashub and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool that is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
[4]
Tell him, ‘Make sure you stay calm! Don’t be afraid. Don’t be intimidated by these two stubs of smoking logs, or by the raging anger of Rezin, Syria, and the son of Remaliah.
[5]
Syria has plotted with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah to bring about your demise.
[6]
They say, “Let’s attack Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it. Then we’ll set up the son of Tabeel as its king.”
[7]
 For this reason the Sovereign Lord says: “‘It will not take place;it will not happen.
[poetry]

[8]
 For Syria’s leader is Damascus, and the leader of Damascus is Rezin.Within 65 years Ephraim will no longer exist as a nation.
[poetry]

[9]
 Ephraim’s leader is Samaria, and Samaria’s leader is the son of Remaliah.If your faith does not remain firm, then you will not remain secure.’”
[bodytext]

[10]
The Lord again spoke to Ahaz:
[11]
“Ask for a confirming sign from the Lord your God. You can even ask for something miraculous.”
[12]
But Ahaz responded, “I don’t want to ask; I don’t want to put the Lord to a test.”
[13]
So Isaiah replied, “Pay attention, family of David. Do you consider it too insignificant to try the patience of men? Is that why you are also trying the patience of my God?
[14]
For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.
[15]
He will eat sour milk and honey, which will help him know how to reject evil and choose what is right.
[16]
Here is why this will be so: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose what is right, the land whose two kings you fear will be desolate.
[17]
 The Lord will bring on you, your people, and your father’s family a time unlike any since Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”
[bodytext]

[18]
At that time the Lord will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
[19]
All of them will come and make their home in the ravines between the cliffs and in the crevices of the cliffs, in all the thornbushes, and in all the watering holes.
[20]
At that time the Lord will use a razor hired from the banks of the Euphrates River, the king of Assyria, to shave the hair off the head and private parts; it will also shave off the beard.
[21]
At that time a man will keep alive a young cow from the herd and a couple of goats.
[22]
From the abundance of milk they produce, he will have sour milk for his meals. Indeed, everyone left in the heart of the land will eat sour milk and honey.
[23]
At that time every place where there had been 1,000 vines worth 1,000 silver shekels will be overrun with thorns and briers.
[24]
With bow and arrow people will hunt there, for the whole land will be covered with thorns and briers.
[25]
 They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated for fear of the thorns and briers. Cattle will graze there, and sheep will trample on them.

Chapter 8
[bodytext]

[8:1]
The Lord told me, “Take a large tablet and inscribe these words on it with an ordinary stylus: ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’
[2]
Then I will summon as my reliable witnesses Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
[3]
I then approached the prophetess for marital relations; she conceived and gave birth to a son. The Lord told me, “Name him Maher Shalal Hash Baz,
[4]
 for before the child knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
[bodytext]

[5]
The Lord spoke to me again:
[6]
“These people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and melt in fear over Rezin and the son of Remaliah.
[7]
So look, the Lord is bringing up against them the turbulent and mighty waters of the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his majestic power. It will reach flood stage and overflow its banks.
[8]
 It will spill into Judah, flooding and engulfing, as it reaches to the necks of its victims. He will spread his wings out over your entire land, O Immanuel.”
[poetry]

[9]
 You will be broken, O nations; you will be shattered! Pay attention, all you distant lands of the earth.Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!Get ready for battle, and you will be shattered!
[poetry]

[10]
 Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted. Issue your orders, but they will not be executed! For God is with us!
[bodytext]

[11]
 Indeed this is what the Lord told me quite forcefully. He warned me not to act like these people:
[poetry]

[12]
 “Do not say, ‘Conspiracy,’ every time these people say the word. Don’t be afraid of what scares them; don’t be terrified.
[poetry]

[13]
 You must recognize the authority of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. He is the one you must respect; he is the one you must fear.
[poetry]

[14]
 He will become a sanctuary, but a stone that makes a person trip and a rock that makes one stumble—to the two houses of Israel. He will become a trap and a snareto the residents of Jerusalem.
[poetry]

[15]
 Many will stumble over the stone and the rock, and will fall and be seriously injured,and will be ensnared and captured.”
[poetry]

[16]
 Tie up the scroll as legal evidence, seal the official record of God’s instructions, and give it to my followers.
[poetry]

[17]
 I will wait patiently for the Lord,who has rejected the family of Jacob; I will wait for him.
[poetrybreak]

[18]
 Look, I and the sons whom the Lord has given me are reminders and object lessons in Israel, sent from the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, who lives on Mount Zion.
[bodytext]

[19]
They will say to you, “Seek oracles at the pits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and mutter incantations. Should people not seek oracles from their gods, by asking the dead about the destiny of the living?”
[20]
Then you must recall the Lord’s instructions and the prophetic testimony of what would happen. Certainly they say such things because their minds are spiritually darkened.
[21]
They will pass through the land destitute and starving. Their hunger will make them angry, and they will curse their king and their God as they look upward.
[22]
 When one looks out over the land, he sees distress and darkness, gloom and anxiety, darkness and people forced from the land.

Chapter 9
[poetry]

[9:1]
 (8:23) The gloom will be dispelled for those who were anxious. In earlier times he humiliatedthe land of Zebulun,and the land of Naphtali; but now he brings honor to the way of the sea,the region beyond the Jordan,and Galilee of the nations.
[poetry]

[2]
 (9:1) The people walking in darknesssee a bright light; light shines on those who live in a land of deep darkness.
[poetry]

[3]
 You have enlarged the nation;you give them great joy. They rejoice in your presenceas harvesters rejoice;as warriors celebrate when they divide up the plunder.
[poetry]

[4]
 For their oppressive yokeand the club that strikes their shoulders,the cudgel the oppressor uses on them, you have shattered, as in the day of Midian’s defeat.
[poetry]

[5]
 Indeed every boot that marches and shakes the earth and every garment dragged through bloodis used as fuel for the fire.
[poetry]

[6]
 For a child has been born to us,a son has been given to us.He shoulders responsibility and is called Wonderful Adviser, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[poetry]

[7]
 His dominion will be vast, and he will bring immeasurable prosperity. He will rule on David’s throneand over David’s kingdom, establishing it and strengthening itby promoting justice and fairness, from this time forward and forevermore.The zeal of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
[poetry]

[8]
  The Lord decreed judgment on Jacob,and it fell on Israel.
[poetry]

[9]
 All the people were aware of it,the people of Ephraim and those living in Samaria. Yet with pride and an arrogant attitude, they said,
[poetry]

[10]
 “The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild with chiseled stone;the sycamore fig trees have been cut down,but we will replace them with cedars.”
[poetry]

[11]
 Then the Lord provoked their adversaries to attack them, he stirred up their enemies—
[poetry]

[12]
 Syria from the east,and the Philistines from the west;they gobbled up Israelite territory. Despite all this, his anger does not subside,and his hand is ready to strike again.
[poetry]

[13]
 The people did not return to the one who struck them,they did not seek reconciliation with the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.
[poetry]

[14]
 So the Lord cut off Israel’s head and tail,both the shoots and stalk in one day.
[poetry]

[15]
 The leaders and the highly respected people are the head,the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
[poetry]

[16]
 The leaders of this nation were misleading people,and the people being led were destroyed.
[poetry]

[17]
 So the Lord was not pleased with their young men,he took no pity on their orphans and widows;for the whole nation was godless and did wicked things, every mouth was speaking disgraceful words. Despite all this, his anger does not subside,and his hand is ready to strike again.
[poetry]

[18]

At that time the Lord announced through Isaiah son of Amoz: “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and take your sandals off your feet.” He did as instructed and walked around in undergarments and barefoot.
[3]
Later the Lord explained, “In the same way that my servant Isaiah has walked around in undergarments and barefoot for the past three years, as an object lesson and omen pertaining to Egypt and Cush,
[4]
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, both young and old. They will be in undergarments and barefoot, with the buttocks exposed; the Egyptians will be publicly humiliated.
[5]
Those who put their hope in Cush and took pride in Egypt will be afraid and embarrassed.
[6]
 At that time those who live on this coast will say, ‘Look what has happened to our source of hope to whom we fled for help, expecting to be rescued from the king of Assyria! How can we escape now?’”

[2]
 I have received a distressing message: “The deceiver deceives,the destroyer destroys.Attack, you Elamites!Lay siege, you Medes!I will put an end to all the groaning.”
[poetry]

[3]
 For this reason my stomach churns; cramps overwhelm melike the contractions of a woman in labor.I am disturbed by what I hear,horrified by what I see.
[poetry]

[4]
 My heart palpitates, I shake in fear; the twilight I desiredhas brought me terror.
[poetry]

[5]
 Arrange the table,lay out the carpet,eat and drink! Get up, you officers,smear oil on the shields!
[poetry]

[6]
 For this is what the Lord has told me:“Go, post a guard!He must report what he sees.
[poetry]

[7]
 When he sees chariots, teams of horses, riders on donkeys,riders on camels,he must be alert,very alert.”
[poetry]

[8]
 Then the guard cries out:“On the watchtower, O Lord, I stand all day long;at my postI am stationed every night.
[poetry]

[9]
 Look what’s coming!A charioteer,a team of horses.” When questioned, he replies, “Babylon has fallen, fallen!All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”
[poetry]

 O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor, what I have heard from the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,the God of Israel,I have reported to you.
[poetry]

[11]
 This is an oracle about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night?Watchman, what is left of the night?”

[12]
 The watchman replies,“Morning is coming, but then night. If you want to ask, ask;come back again.”

[bodytext]

[16]
For this is what the Lord has told me: “Within exactly one year all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end.
[17]
 Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left.” Indeed, the Lord God of Israel has spoken.

Chapter 22
[poetry]

[22:1]
 This is an oracle about the Valley of Vision: What is the reason that all of you go up to the rooftops?
[poetry]

[2]
 The noisy city is full of raucous sounds;the town is filled with revelry. Your slain were not cut down by the sword;they did not die in battle.
[poetry]

[3]
  All your leaders ran away together—they fled to a distant place;all your refugees were captured together—they were captured without a single arrow being shot.
[poetry]

[4]
 So I say:“Don’t look at me! I am weeping bitterly.Don’t try to console meconcerning the destruction of my defenseless people.”
[poetry]

[5]
 For the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armieshas planned a day of panic, defeat, and confusion. In the Valley of Vision people shout and cry out to the hill.
[poetry]

[6]
 The Elamites picked up the quiverand came with chariots and horsemen; the men of Kir prepared the shield.
[poetry]

[7]
 Your very best valleys were full of chariots; horsemen confidently took their positions at the gate.
[poetry]

[8]
 They removed the defenses of Judah.At that time you lookedfor the weapons in the House of the Forest.
[poetry]

[9]
 You saw the many breaksin the walls of the City of David; you stored up water in the lower pool.
[poetry]

[10]
 You counted the houses in Jerusalem and demolished houses so you could have material to reinforce the wall.
[poetry]

[11]
 You made a reservoir between the two wallsfor the water of the old pool—but you did not trust in the one who made it; you did not depend on the one who formed it long ago.
[poetry]

[12]
 At that time the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies called for weeping and mourning,for shaved heads and sackcloth.
[poetry]

[13]
 But look, there is outright celebration! You say, “Kill the ox and slaughter the sheep,eat meat and drink wine.Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”
[bodytext]

[14]
 The Lord of Heaven’s Armies told me this: “Certainly this sin will not be forgiven as long as you live,” says the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies.
[poetry]

[15]
 This is what the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies says:“Go visit this administrator, Shebna, who supervises the palace, and tell him:
[poetry]

[16]
 ‘What right do you have to be here? What relatives do you have buried here? Why do you chisel out a tomb for yourself here?He chisels out his burial site in an elevated place,he carves out his tomb on a cliff.
[poetry]

[17]
 Look, the Lord will throw you far away, you mere man! He will wrap you up tightly.
[poetry]

[18]
 He will wind you up tightly into a balland throw you into a wide, open land. There you will die,and there with you will be your impressive chariots, which bring disgrace to the house of your master.
[poetry]

[19]
 I will remove you from your office;you will be thrown down from your position.
[bodytext]

[20]
“‘At that time I will summon my servant Eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
[21]
I will put your robe on him, tie your belt around him, and transfer your authority to him. He will become a protector of the residents of Jerusalem and of the people of Judah.
[22]
I will place the key to the house of David on his shoulder. When he opens the door, no one can close it; when he closes the door, no one can open it.
[23]
I will fasten him like a peg into a solid place; he will bring honor and respect to his father’s family.
[24]
 His father’s family will gain increasing prominence because of him, including the offspring and the offshoots. All the small containers, including the bowls and all the jars, will hang from this peg.’
[bodytext]

[25]
 “At that time,” says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, “the peg fastened into a solid place will come loose. It will be cut off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off.” Indeed, the Lord has spoken.

Chapter 23
[poetry]

[23:1]
 This is an oracle about Tyre:Wail, you large ships, for the port is too devastated to enter! From the land of Cyprus this news is announced to them.
[poetry]

[2]
Lament, you residents of the coast,you merchants of Sidon who travel over the sea,whose agents sail over
[3]
 the deep waters. Grain from the Shihor region, crops grown near the Nile she receives; she is the trade center of the nations.
[poetry]

[4]
 Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea says this, O fortress of the sea:“I have not gone into labor or given birth;I have not raised young menor brought up young women.”
[poetry]

[5]
 When the news reaches Egypt,they will be shaken by what has happened to Tyre.
[poetry]

[6]
 Travel to Tarshish!Wail, you residents of the coast!
[poetry]

[7]
 Is this really your boisterous city whose origins are in the distant past and whose feet led her to a distant land to reside?
[poetry]

[8]
 Who planned this for royal Tyre, whose merchants are princes,whose traders are the dignitaries of the earth?
[poetry]

[9]
 The Lord of Heaven’s Armies planned it—to dishonor the pride that comes from all her beauty, to humiliate all the dignitaries of the earth.
[poetry]

[10]
 Daughter Tarshish, travel back to your land, as one crosses the Nile;there is no longer any marketplace in Tyre.
[poetry]

[11]
 The Lord stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook kingdoms;he gave the order to destroy Canaan’s fortresses.
[poetry]

[12]
 He said,“You will no longer celebrate,oppressed virgin daughter Sidon!Get up, travel to Cyprus,but you will find no relief there.”
[poetry]

[13]
 Look at the land of the Chaldeans,these people who have lost their identity! The Assyrians have made it a home for wild animals.They erected their siege towers, demolished its fortresses,and turned it into a heap of ruins.
[poetry]

[14]
 Wail, you large ships, for your fortress is destroyed!
[bodytext]

[15]
 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for 70 years, the typical life span of a king. At the end of 70 years Tyre will try to attract attention again, like the prostitute in the popular song:
[poetry]

[16]
 “Take the harp,go through the city,forgotten prostitute!Play it well,play lots of songs,so you’ll be noticed.”
[bodytext]

[17]
At the end of 70 years the Lord will revive Tyre. She will start making money again by selling her services to all the earth’s kingdoms.
[18]
 Her profits and earnings will be set apart for the Lord. They will not be stored up or accumulated, for her profits will be given to those who live in the Lord’s presence and will be used to purchase large quantities of food and beautiful clothes.

Chapter 24
[poetry]

[24:1]
 Look, the Lord is ready to devastate the earthand leave it in ruins;he will mar its surfaceand scatter its inhabitants.
[poetry]

[2]
 Everyone will suffer—the priest as well as the people, the master as well as the servant, the elegant lady as well as the female attendant, the seller as well as the buyer, the borrower as well as the lender, the creditor as well as the debtor.
[poetry]

[3]
 The earth will be completely devastatedand thoroughly ransacked.For the Lord has decreed this judgment.
[poetry]

[4]
 The earth dries up and withers,the world shrivels up and withers;the prominent people of the earth fade away.
[poetry]

[5]
 The earth is defiled by its inhabitants, for they have violated laws,disregarded the regulation, and broken the permanent treaty.
[poetry]

[6]
 So a treaty curse devours the earth;its inhabitants pay for their guilt. This is why the inhabitants of the earth disappear, and are reduced to just a handful of people.
[poetry]

[7]
 The new wine dries up,the vines shrivel up,all those who like to celebrate groan.
[poetry]

[8]
 The happy sound of the tambourines stops,the revelry of those who celebrate comes to a halt,the happy sound of the harp ceases.
[poetry]

[9]
 They no longer sing and drink wine; the beer tastes bitter to those who drink it.
[poetry]

[10]
 The ruined town is shattered;all the houses are shut up tight.
[poetry]

[11]
 They howl in the streets because of what happened to the wine; all joy turns to sorrow; celebrations disappear from the earth.
[poetry]

[12]
 The city is left in ruins; the gate is reduced to rubble.
[poetry]

[13]
 This is what will happen throughout the earth,among the nations.It will be like when they beat an olive tree,and just a few olives are left at the end of the harvest.
[poetry]

[14]
 They lift their voices and shout joyfully;they praise the majesty of the Lord in the west.
[poetry]

[15]
 So in the east extol the Lord,along the seacoasts extol the fame of the Lord God of Israel.
[poetry]

[16]
 From the ends of the earth we hear songs—the Just One is majestic. But I say, “I’m wasting away! I’m wasting away! I’m doomed!Deceivers deceive, deceivers thoroughly deceive!”
[poetry]

[17]
 Terror, pit, and snareare ready to overtake you, inhabitants of the earth!
[poetry]

[18]
 The one who runs away from the sound of the terrorwill fall into the pit; the one who climbs out of the pitwill be trapped by the snare.For the floodgates of the heavens are opened up and the foundations of the earth shake.
[poetry]

[19]
 The earth is broken in pieces,the earth is ripped to shreds,the earth shakes violently.
[poetry]

[20]
 The earth will stagger around like a drunk;it will sway back and forth like a hut in a windstorm. Its sin will weigh it down,and it will fall and never get up again.
[poetry]

[21]
 At that time the Lord will punish the heavenly forces in the heavens and the earthly kings on the earth.
[poetry]

[22]
 They will be imprisoned in a pit, locked up in a prison,and after staying there for a long time, they will be punished.
[poetry]

[23]
 The full moon will be covered up, the bright sun will be darkened; for the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will rule on Mount Zion in Jerusalem in the presence of his assembly, in majestic splendor.

Chapter 25
[poetry]

[25:1]
 O Lord, you are my God! I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame. For you have done extraordinary things,and executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
[poetry]

[2]
 Indeed, you have made the city into a heap of rubble,the fortified town into a heap of ruins;the fortress of foreigners is no longer a city,it will never be rebuilt.
[poetry]

[3]
 So a strong nation will extol you;the towns of powerful nations will fear you.
[poetry]

[4]
 For you are a protector for the poor,a protector for the needy in their distress,a shelter from the rainstorm,a shade from the heat.Though the breath of tyrants is like a winter rainstorm,
[poetry]

[5]
 like heat in a dry land,you humble the boasting foreigners. Just as the shadow of a cloud causes the heat to subside, so he causes the song of tyrants to cease.
[poetry]

[6]
 The Lord of Heaven’s Armies will hold a banquet for all the nations on this mountain. At this banquet there will be plenty of meat and aged wine—tender meat and choicest wine.
[poetry]

[7]
 On this mountain he will swallow up the shroud that is over all the peoples, the woven covering that is over all the nations;
[poetry]

[8]
 he will swallow up death permanently. The Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from every face,and remove his people’s disgrace from all the earth.Indeed, the Lord has announced it!
[poetry]

[9]
 At that time they will say, “Look, here is our God!We waited for him, and he delivered us.Here is the Lord! We waited for him.Let’s rejoice and celebrate his deliverance!”
[poetry]

[10]
 For the Lord’s power will make this mountain secure. Moab will be trampled down where it stands, as a heap of straw is trampled down in a manure pile.
[poetry]

[11]
 Moab will spread out its hands in the middle of it, just as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim; the Lord will bring down Moab’s pride as it spreads its hands.
[poetry]

[12]
 The fortified city (along with the very tops of your walls) he will knock down,he will bring it down, he will throw it down to the dusty ground.

Chapter 26
[poetry]

[26:1]
 At that time this song will be sung in the land of Judah:“We have a strong city!The Lord’s deliverance, like walls and a rampart, makes it secure.
[poetry]

[2]
 Open the gates so a righteous nation can enter—one that remains trustworthy.
[poetry]

[3]
 You keep completely safe the people who maintain their faith,for they trust in you.
[poetry]

[4]
 Trust in the Lord from this time forward, even in Yah, the Lord, an enduring protector!
[poetry]

[5]
 Indeed, the Lord knocks down those who live in a high place,he brings down an elevated town;he brings it down to the ground, he throws it down to the dust.
[poetry]

[6]
 It is trampled underfootby the feet of the oppressed,by the soles of the poor.”
[poetry]

[7]
  The way of the righteous is level, the path of the righteous that you prepare is straight.
[poetry]

[8]
 Yes, as your judgments unfold, O Lord, we wait for you.We desire your fame and reputation to grow.
[poetry]

[9]
 I look for you during the night;my spirit within me seeks you at dawn;for when your judgments come upon the earth,those who live in the world learn about justice.
[poetry]

[10]
 If the wicked are shown mercy,they do not learn about justice. Even in a land where right is rewarded, they act unjustly; they do not see the Lord’s majesty revealed.
[poetry]

[11]
 O Lord, you are ready to act, but they don’t even notice.They will see and be put to shame by your angry judgment against humankind; yes, fire will consume your enemies.
[poetry]

[12]
 O Lord, you make us secure, for even all we have accomplished you have done for us.
[poetry]

[13]
 O Lord, our God,masters other than you have ruled us,but we praise your name alone.
[poetry]

[14]
 The dead do not come back to life,the spirits of the dead do not rise. That is because you came in judgment and destroyed them,you wiped out all memory of them.
[poetry]

[15]
 You have made the nation larger, O Lord;you have made the nation larger and revealed your splendor; you have extended all the borders of the land.
[poetry]

[16]
 O Lord, in distress they looked for you;they uttered incantations because of your discipline.
[poetry]

[17]
 As when a pregnant woman gets ready to deliverand strains and cries out because of her labor pains,so were we because of you, O Lord.
[poetry]

[18]
 We were pregnant, we strained,we gave birth, as it were, to wind. We cannot produce deliverance on the earth;no people are born to populate the world.
[poetry]

[19]
  Your dead will come back to life;your corpses will rise up.Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground! For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew, and the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
[poetry]

[20]
 Go, my people! Enter your inner rooms!Close your doors behind you!Hide for a little while,until his angry judgment is over.
[poetry]

[21]
 For look, the Lord is coming out of the place where he lives to punish the sin of those who live on the earth.The earth will display the blood shed on it;it will no longer cover up its slain.

Chapter 27
[poetry]

[27:1]
 At that time the Lord will punishwith his destructive, great, and powerful swordLeviathan the fast-moving serpent,Leviathan the squirming serpent;he will kill the sea monster.
[poetry]

[2]
 When that time comes, sing about a delightful vineyard!
[poetry]

[3]
 “I, the Lord, protect it; I water it regularly. I guard it night and day,so no one can harm it.
[poetry]

[4]
 I am not angry.I wish I could confront some thorns and briers!Then I would march against them for battle;I would set them all on fire,
[poetry]

[5]
 unless they became my subjects and made peace with me;let them make peace with me.”
[poetry]

[6]
 The time is coming when Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and grow branches.The produce will fill the surface of the world.
[poetry]

[7]
 Has the Lord struck down Israel as he did their oppressors? Has Israel been killed like their enemies?
[poetry]

[8]
 When you summon her for divorce, you prosecute her; he drives her away with his strong wind in the day of the east wind.
[poetry]

[9]
 So in this way Jacob’s sin will be forgiven, and this is how they will show they are finished sinning: They will make all the stones of the altars like crushed limestone,and the Asherah poles and the incense altars will no longer stand.
[poetry]

[10]
 For the fortified city is left alone;it is a deserted settlementand abandoned like the wilderness.Calves graze there;they lie down thereand eat its branches bare.
[poetry]

[11]
 When its branches get brittle, they break;women come and use them for kindling. For these people lack understanding, therefore the one who made them has no compassion on them;the one who formed them has no mercy on them.
[bodytext]

[12]
At that time the Lord will shake the tree, from the Euphrates River to the Stream of Egypt. Then you will be gathered up one by one, O Israelites.
[13]
 At that time a large trumpet will be blown, and the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come, as well as the refugees in the land of Egypt. They will worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

Chapter 28
[poetry]

[28:1]
 The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkards is doomed, the withering flower, its beautiful splendor, situated at the head of a rich valley,the crown of those overcome with wine.
[poetry]

[2]
 Look, the Lord sends a strong, powerful one. With the force of a hailstorm or a destructive windstorm, with the might of a driving, torrential rainstorm, he will knock that crown to the ground with his hand.
[poetry]

[3]
 The splendid crown of Ephraim’s drunkardswill be trampled underfoot.
[poetry]

[4]
 The withering flower, its beautiful splendor,situated at the head of a rich valley, will be like an early fig before harvest—as soon as someone notices it,he grabs it and swallows it.
[poetry]

[5]
 At that time the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will become a beautiful crown and a splendid diadem for the remnant of his people.
[poetry]

[6]
 He will give discernment to the one who makes judicial decisionsand strength to those who defend the city from attackers.
[poetry]

[7]
 Even these men stagger because of wine;they stumble around because of beer—priests and prophets stagger because of beer,they are confused because of wine,they stumble around because of beer;they stagger while seeing prophetic visions, they totter while making legal decisions.
[poetry]

[8]
 Indeed, all the tablesare covered with vomit,with filth, leaving no clean place.
[poetry]

[9]
 Who is the Lord trying to teach?To whom is he explaining a message? To those just weaned from milk!To those just taken from their mother’s breast!
[poetry]

[10]
 Indeed, they will hear meaningless gibberish,senseless babbling,a syllable here, a syllable there.
[poetry]

[11]
 For with mocking lips and a foreign tonguehe will speak to these people.
[poetry]

[12]
 In the past he said to them, “This is where security can be found.Provide security for the one who is exhausted.This is where rest can be found.” But they refused to listen.
[poetry]

[13]
 So the Lord’s message to them will sound likemeaningless gibberish,senseless babbling,a syllable here, a syllable there. As a result, they will fall on their backsides when they try to walk, and be injured, ensnared, and captured.
[poetry]

[14]
 Therefore, listen to the Lord’s message,you who mock,you rulers of these peoplewho reside in Jerusalem.
[poetry]

[15]
 For you say,“We have made a treaty with death,with Sheol we have made an agreement. When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by it will not reach us.For we have made a lie our refuge,we have hidden ourselves in a deceitful word.”
[poetry]

[16]
 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord, says:“Look, I am laying a stone in Zion,an approved stone,set in place as a precious cornerstone for the foundation. The one who maintains his faith will not panic.
[poetry]

[17]
 I will make justice the measuring line,fairness the plumb line;hail will sweep away the unreliable refuge, the floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place.
[poetry]

[18]
 Your treaty with death will be dissolved; your agreement with Sheol will not last. When the overwhelming judgment sweeps by, you will be overrun by it.
[poetry]

[19]
 Whenever it sweeps by, it will overtake you;indeed, every morning it will sweep by,it will come through during the day and the night.” When this announcement is understood,it will cause nothing but terror.
[poetry]

[20]
 For the bed is too short to stretch out on,and the blanket is too narrow to wrap around oneself.
[poetry]

[21]
 For the Lord will rise up, as he did at Mount Perazim; he will rouse himself, as he did in the Valley of Gibeon, to accomplish his work,his peculiar work,to perform his task,his strange task.
[poetry]

[22]
 So now, do not mock,or your chains will become heavier!For I have heard a message about decreed destruction,from the Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies against the entire land.
[poetry]

[23]
 Pay attention and listen to my message. Be attentive and listen to what I have to say!
[poetry]

[24]
 Does a farmer just keep on plowing at planting time? Does he keep breaking up and harrowing his ground?
[poetry]

[25]
 Once he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter the seed of the caraway plant,sow the seed of the cumin plant,and plant the wheat, barley, and grain in their designated places?
[poetry]

[26]
 His God instructs him;he teaches him the principles of agriculture.
[poetry]

[27]
 Certainly caraway seed is not threshed with a sledge,nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin seed. Certainly caraway seed is beaten with a stickand cumin seed with a flail.
[poetry]

[28]
 Grain is crushed,though one certainly does not thresh it forever.The wheel of one’s wagon rolls over it,but his horses do not crush it.
[poetry]

[29]
 This also comes from the Lord of Heaven’s Armies,who gives supernatural guidance and imparts great wisdom.

Chapter 29
[poetry]

[29:1]
 Ariel is as good as dead—Ariel, the town David besieged! Keep observing your annual rituals;celebrate your festivals on schedule.
[poetry]

[2]
 I will threaten Ariel,and she will mourn intenselyand become like an altar hearth before me.
[poetry]

[3]
 I will lay siege to you on all sides; I will besiege you with troops; I will raise siege works against you.
[poetry]

[4]
 You will fall; while lying on the ground you will speak;from the dust where you lie, your words will be heard. Your voice will sound like a spirit speaking from the underworld; from the dust you will chirp as if muttering an incantation.
[poetry]

[5]
 But the horde of invaders will be like fine dust,the horde of tyrants like chaff that is blown away.It will happen suddenly, in a flash.
[poetry]

[6]
 Judgment will come from the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, accompanied by thunder, earthquake, and a loud noise,by a strong gale, a windstorm, and a consuming flame of fire.
[poetry]

[7]
 It will be like a dream, a night vision.There will be a horde from all the nations that fight against Ariel,those who attack her and her stronghold and besiege her.
[poetry]

[8]
 It will be like a hungry man dreaming that he is eating,only to awaken and find that his stomach is empty. It will be like a thirsty man dreaming that he is drinking,only to awaken and find that he is still weak and his thirst unquenched. So it will be for the horde from all the nationsthat fight against Mount Zion.
[poetry]

[9]
 You will be shocked and amazed! You are totally blind! They are drunk, but not because of wine;they stagger, but not because of beer.
[poetry]

[10]
 For the Lord has poured out on youa strong urge to sleep deeply. He has shut your eyes (you prophets),and covered your heads (you seers).
[bodytext]

[11]
To you this entire prophetic revelation is like words in a sealed scroll. When they hand it to one who can read and say, “Read this,” he responds, “I can’t, because it is sealed.”
[12]
 Or when they hand the scroll to one who can’t read and say, “Read this,” he says, “I can’t read.”
[poetry]

[13]
 The Lord says,“These people say they are loyal to me; they say wonderful things about me, but they are not really loyal to me. Their worship consists of nothing but man-made ritual.
[poetry]

[14]
 Therefore I will again do an amazing thing for these people—an absolutely extraordinary deed. Wise men will have nothing to say,the sages will have no explanations.”
[poetry]

[15]
 Those who try to hide their plans from the Lord are as good as dead, who do their work in secret and boast, “Who sees us? Who knows what we’re doing?”
[poetry]

[16]
 Your thinking is perverse! Should the potter be regarded as clay? Should the thing made say about its maker, “He didn’t make me”?Or should the pottery say about the potter, “He doesn’t understand”?
[poetry]

[17]
 In just a very short time Lebanon will turn into an orchard,and the orchard will be considered a forest.
[poetry]

[18]
 At that time the deaf will be able to hear words read from a scroll,and the eyes of the blind will be able to see through deep darkness.
[poetry]

[19]
 The downtrodden will again rejoice in the Lord;the poor among humankind will take delight in the Holy One of Israel.
[poetry]

[20]
 For tyrants will disappear,those who taunt will vanish,and all those who love to do wrong will be eliminated—
[poetry]

 This is an oracle about the animals in the Negev:Through a land of distress and danger,inhabited by lionesses and roaring lions, by snakes and darting adders, they transport their wealth on the backs of donkeys,their riches on the humps of camels,to a nation that cannot help them.

[poetry]

[13]
 So this sin will become your downfall.You will be like a high wall that bulges and cracks and is ready to collapse;it crumbles suddenly, in a flash.

Chapter 31
[poetry]

[31:1]
 Those who go down to Egypt for help are as good as dead; those who rely on war horsesand trust in Egypt’s many chariots and in their many, many horsemen. But they do not rely on the Holy One of Israel and do not seek help from the Lord.
[poetry]

[2]
 Yet he too is wise and he will bring disaster;he does not retract his decree. He will attack the wicked nation and the nation that helps those who commit sin.

 Indeed, this is what the Lord has said to me:“The Lord will be like a growling lion,like a young lion growling over its prey.

 Look, a king will promote fairness; officials will promote justice.

 Eyes will no longer be blind and ears will be attentive.
[poetry]

 The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment, and the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity.
[poetry]

[5]
 A fool will no longer be called honorable;a deceiver will no longer be called principled.
[poetry]

[6]
 For a fool speaks disgraceful things; his mind plans out sinful deeds. He commits godless deeds and says misleading things about the Lord;he gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite and gives the thirsty nothing to drink.
[poetry]

[7]
 A deceiver’s methods are evil; he dreams up evil plans to ruin the poor with lies,even when the needy are in the right.

[poetry]

[13]
 Mourn over the land of my people,which is overgrown with thorns and briers,and over all the once-happy houses in the city filled with revelry.
[poetry]

[14]
 For the fortress is neglected;the once-crowded city is abandoned.Hill and watchtowerare permanently uninhabited. Wild donkeys love to go there,and flocks graze there.
[poetry]

[15]
 This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven. Then the wilderness will become an orchardand the orchard will be considered a forest.
[poetry]

[16]
 Justice will settle down in the wildernessand fairness will live in the orchard.
[poetry]

[17]
 Fairness will produce peace and result in lasting security.
[poetry]

[18]
 My people will live in peaceful settlements,in secure homes,and in safe, quiet places.
[poetry]

[19]
 Even if the forest is destroyed and the city is annihilated,
[poetry]

[20]
 you will be blessed,you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams, you who let your ox and donkey graze.

Chapter 33
[poetry]

[33:1]
 The destroyer is as good as dead, you who have not been destroyed!The deceitful one is as good as dead, the one whom others have not deceived!When you are through destroying, you will be destroyed;when you finish deceiving, others will deceive you!
[poetry]

[2]
 Lord, be merciful to us! We wait for you.Give us strength each morning. Deliver us when distress comes.
[poetry]

[poetry]

[7]
 Look, ambassadors cry out in the streets;messengers sent to make peace weep bitterly.
[poetry]

[8]
 Highways are empty; there are no travelers. Treaties are broken; witnesses are despised; human life is treated with disrespect.
[poetry]

[9]
 The land dries up and withers away;the forest of Lebanon shrivels up and decays.Sharon is like the arid rift valley; Bashan and Carmel are parched.
[poetry]

[10]
 “Now I will rise up,” says the Lord.“Now I will exalt myself;now I will magnify myself.
[poetry]

[11]

[poetry]

[13]
 You who are far away, listen to what I have done!You who are close by, recognize my strength.”

[14]
 Sinners are afraid in Zion;panic grips the godless. They say, “Who among us can coexist with destructive fire?Who among us can coexist with unquenchable fire?”
[poetry]

[15]
 The one who lives uprightly and speaks honestly,the one who refuses to profit from oppressive measuresand rejects a bribe, the one who does not plot violent crimes and does not seek to harm others—
[poetry]

[16]
 this is the person who will live in a secure place; he will find safety in the rocky, mountain strongholds; he will have foodand a constant supply of water.
[poetry]

[17]
 You will see a king in his splendor; you will see a wide land.
[poetry]

[18]
 Your mind will recall the terror you experienced, and you will ask yourselves, “Where is the scribe?Where is the one who weighs the money?Where is the one who counts the towers?”
[poetry]

[19]
 You will no longer see a defiant peoplewhose language you do not comprehend, whose derisive speech you do not understand.
[poetry]

[20]
 Look at Zion, the city where we hold religious festivals!You will see Jerusalem, a peaceful settlement,a tent that stays put; its stakes will never be pulled up;none of its ropes will snap in two.
[poetry]

[21]
 Instead the Lord will rule there as our mighty king. Rivers and wide streams will flow through it; no war galley will enter; no large ships will sail through.
[poetry]

[22]
 For the Lord, our ruler,the Lord, our  commander,the Lord, our king—he will deliver us.
[poetry]

[23]
 Though at this time your ropes are slack, the  mast is not secured, and the sail is not unfurled,at that time you will divide up a great quantity of loot; even the lame will drag off plunder.
[poetry]

[24]
 No resident of Zion will say, “I am ill”;the people who live there will have their sin forgiven.

Chapter 34
[poetry]

[34:1]
 Come near, you nations, and listen!Pay attention, you people!The earth and everything it contains must listen,the world and everything that lives in it.

 For the Lord is angry at all the nationsand furious with all their armies.He will annihilate them and slaughter them.
[poetry]

[3]
 Their slain will be left unburied, their corpses will stink; the hills will soak up their blood.
[poetry]

 All the stars in the sky will fade away, the sky will roll up like a scroll;all its stars will wither,like a leaf withers and falls from a vineor a fig withers and falls from a tree.

[5]
 He says, “Indeed, my sword has slaughtered heavenly powers. Look, it now descends on Edom, on the people I will annihilate in judgment.”
[poetry]

[6]
 The Lord’s sword is dripping with blood,it is covered with fat;it drips with the blood of young rams and goatsand is covered with the fat of rams’ kidneys.For the Lord is holding a sacrifice in Bozrah, a bloody slaughter in the land of Edom.
[poetry]

[7]
 Wild oxen will be slaughtered along with them,as well as strong bulls. Their land is drenched with blood,their soil is covered with fat.
[poetry]

[8]
 For the Lord has planned a day of revenge, a time when he will repay Edom for her hostility toward Zion.
[poetry]

[9]
 Edom’s streams will be turned into pitchand her soil into brimstone;her land will become burning pitch.
[poetry]

[10]
 Night and day it will burn; its smoke will ascend continually.Generation after generation it will be a wasteland,and no one will ever pass through it again.
[poetry]

[11]
 Owls and wild animals will live there, all kinds of wild birds will settle in it.The Lord will stretch out over herthe measuring line of ruinand the plumb line of destruction.
[poetry]

[12]
 Her nobles will have nothing left to call a kingdom,and all her officials will disappear.
[poetry]

[13]
 Her fortresses will be overgrown with thorns;thickets and weeds will grow in her fortified cities.Jackals will settle there;ostriches will live there.
[poetry]

[14]
 Wild animals and wild dogs will congregate there; wild goats will bleat to one another. Yes, nocturnal animals will rest thereand make for themselves a nest.
[poetry]

[15]
 Owls will make nests and lay eggs there;they will hatch them and protect them. Yes, hawks will gather there,each with its mate.
[poetry]

[16]
 Carefully read the scroll of the Lord! Not one of these creatures will be missing, none will lack a mate. For the Lord has issued the decree, and his own Spirit gathers them.
[poetry]

[17]
 He assigns them their allotment; he measures out their assigned place. They will live there permanently;they will settle in it through successive generations.

Chapter 35
[poetry]

[35:1]
 Let the wilderness and desert be happy; let the arid rift valley rejoice and bloom like a lily!
[poetry]

[2]
 Let it richly bloom; let it rejoice and shout with delight! It is given the grandeur of Lebanon,the splendor of Carmel and Sharon.They will see the grandeur of the Lord,the splendor of our God.
[poetry]

[3]
 Strengthen the hands that have gone limp,steady the knees that shake.
[poetry]

[4]
 Tell those who panic, “Be strong! Do not fear!Look, your God comes to avenge;with divine retribution he comes to deliver you.”
[poetry]

[5]
 Then blind eyes will open,deaf ears will hear.
[poetry]

[6]
 Then the lame will leap like a deer,the mute tongue will shout for joy;for water will burst forth in the wilderness,streams in the arid rift valley.
[poetry]

[7]
 The dry soil will become a pool of water,the parched ground springs of water.Where jackals once lived and sprawled out,grass, reeds, and papyrus will grow.
[poetry]

[8]
 A thoroughfare will be there—it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it;it is reserved for those authorized to use it—fools will not stray into it.
[poetry]

[9]
 No lions will be there,no ferocious wild animals will be on it—they will not be found there.Those delivered from bondage will travel on it,
[poetry]

[10]
 those whom the Lord has ransomed will return that way. They will enter Zion with a happy shout.Unending joy will crown them, happiness and joy will overwhelm them;grief and suffering will disappear.

Chapter 36
[bodytext]

[36:1]
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
[2]
The king of Assyria sent his chief adviser from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. The chief adviser stood at the conduit of the upper pool that is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth.
[3]
 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet him.
[bodytext]

[4]
The chief adviser said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: “What is your source of confidence?
[5]
Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk. In whom are you trusting, that you would dare to rebel against me?
[6]
Look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If someone leans on it for support, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him!
[7]
Perhaps you will tell me, ‘We are trusting in the Lord our God.’ But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship at this altar.’
[8]
Now make a deal with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you 2,000 horses, provided you can find enough riders for them.
[9]
Certainly you will not refuse one of my master’s minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
[10]
 Furthermore it was by the command of the Lord that I marched up against this land to destroy it. The Lord told me, ‘March up against this land and destroy it!’”’”
[bodytext]

[11]
Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, “Speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak with us in the Judahite dialect in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
[12]
 But the chief adviser said, “My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you. His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you!”
[bodytext]

[13]
The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect, “Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria.
[14]
This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you!
[15]
Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord by saying, “The Lord will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
[16]
Don’t listen to Hezekiah!’ For this is what the king of Assyria says, ‘Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
[17]
until I come and take you to a land just like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
[18]
Hezekiah is misleading you when he says, “The Lord will rescue us.” Have any of the gods of the nations rescued their lands from the power of the king of Assyria?
[19]
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, did any gods rescue Samaria from my power?
[20]
Who among all the gods of these lands have rescued their lands from my power? So how can the Lord rescue Jerusalem from my power?’”
[21]
 They were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, “Don’t respond to him.”
[bodytext]

[22]
 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him what the chief adviser had said.

Chapter 37
[bodytext]

[37:1]
When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the Lord’s temple.
[2]
Eliakim the palace supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, clothed in sackcloth, sent this message to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz:
[3]
“This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This is a day of distress, insults, and humiliation, as when a baby is ready to leave the birth canal but the mother lacks the strength to push it through.
[4]
 Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all these things the chief adviser has spoken on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria, who sent him to taunt the living God. When the Lord your God hears, perhaps he will punish him for the things he has said. So pray for this remnant that remains.’”
[bodytext]

[5]
When King Hezekiah’s servants came to Isaiah,
[6]
Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master this: ‘This is what the Lord has said: “Don’t be afraid because of the things you have heard—these insults the king of Assyria’s servants have hurled against me.
[7]
 Look, I will take control of his mind; he will receive a report and return to his own land. I will cut him down with a sword in his own land.”’”
[bodytext]

[8]
When the chief adviser heard the king of Assyria had departed from Lachish, he left and went to Libnah, where the king was campaigning.
[9]
The king heard that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was marching out to fight him. He again sent messengers to Hezekiah, ordering them:
[10]
“Tell King Hezekiah of Judah this: ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust mislead you when he says, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”
[11]
Certainly you have heard how the kings of Assyria have annihilated all lands. Do you really think you will be rescued?
[12]
Were the nations whom my predecessors destroyed—the nations of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Telassar—rescued by their gods?
[13]
 Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad or the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”
[bodytext]

[14]
Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the Lord’s temple and spread it out before the Lord.
[15]
Hezekiah prayed before the Lord:
[16]
“O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, O God of Israel, who is enthroned on the cherubim! You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the sky and the earth.
[17]
Pay attention, Lord, and hear! Open your eyes, Lord, and observe! Listen to this entire message Sennacherib sent and how he taunts the living God!
[18]
It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations and their lands.
[19]
They have burned the gods of the nations, for they are not really gods, but only the product of human hands manufactured from wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians could destroy them.
[20]
 Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power, so all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord.”
[poetry]

[21]
Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the Lord God of Israel has said: ‘As to what you have prayed to me concerning King Sennacherib of Assyria,
[22]
 this is what the Lord says about him: “‘The virgin daughter Zion despises you—she makes fun of you;daughter Jerusalem shakes her head after you.
[poetry]

[23]
 “‘Whom have you taunted and hurled insults at?At whom have you shoutedand looked so arrogantly? At the Holy One of Israel!
[poetry]

[24]
 Through your messengers you taunted the Lord, “With my many chariots I climbed upthe high mountains,the slopes of Lebanon.I cut down its tall cedarsand its best evergreens.I invaded its remotest regions, its thickest woods.
[poetry]

[25]
 I dug wellsand drank water. With the soles of my feet I dried upall the rivers of Egypt.”’
[poetry]

[26]
  “Certainly you must have heard! Long ago I worked it out,in ancient times I planned it,and now I am bringing it to pass.The plan is this:Fortified cities will crashinto heaps of ruins.
[poetry]

[27]
 Their residents are powerless; they are terrified and ashamed.They are as short-lived as plants in the fieldor green vegetation. They are as short-lived as grass on the rooftops when it is scorched by the east wind.
[poetry]

[28]
 I know where you liveand everything you doand how you rage against me.
[poetry]

[29]
 Because you rage against meand the uproar you create has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit between your lips,and I will lead you back the way you came.
[bodytext]

[30]
“This will be your reminder that I have spoken the truth: This year you will eat what grows wild, and next year what grows on its own. But the year after that you will plant seed and harvest crops; you will plant vines and consume their produce.
[31]
 Those who remain in Judah will take root in the ground and bear fruit.
[poetry]

[32]
 “For a remnant will leave Jerusalem; survivors will come out of Mount Zion.The zeal of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
[poetry]

[33]
 “So this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: “‘He will not enter this city,nor will he shoot an arrow here. He will not attack it with his shielded warriors, nor will he build siege works against it.
[poetry]

[34]
 He will go back the way he came—he will not enter this city,’ says the Lord.
[poetry]

[35]
 I will shield this city and rescue it for the sake of my reputation and because of my promise to David my servant.”
[bodytext]

[36]
The angel of the Lord went out and killed 185,000 troops in the Assyrian camp. When they got up early the next morning, there were all the corpses!
[37]
So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and went on his way. He went home and stayed in Nineveh.
[38]
 One day, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword. They ran away to the land of Ararat; his son Esarhaddon replaced him as king.

Chapter 38
[bodytext]

[38:1]
In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz visited him and told him, “This is what the Lord says, ‘Give instructions to your household, for you are about to die; you will not get well.’”
[2]
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord,
[3]
 “Please, Lord. Remember how I have served you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, and how I have carried out your will.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.
[bodytext]

[4]
The Lord’s message came to Isaiah,
[5]
“Go and tell Hezekiah: ‘This is what the Lord God of your ancestor David says: “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will add 15 years to your life.
[6]

 Israel will be delivered once and for all by the Lord; you will never again be ashamed or humiliated.
[poetry]

[18]
 For this is what the Lord says,the one who created the sky—he is the true God, the one who formed the earth and made it;he established it,he did not create it without order, he formed it to be inhabited:“I am the Lord, I have no peer.
[poetry]

[19]
 I have not spoken in  secret,in some hidden place. I did not tell Jacob’s descendants,‘Seek me in vain!’ I am the Lord,the one who speaks honestly,who makes reliable announcements.
[poetry]

[20]
 Gather together and come!Approach together, you refugees from the nations.Those who carry wooden idols know nothing,those who pray to a god that cannot deliver.
[poetry]

[21]
 Tell me! Present the evidence! Let them consult with one another.Who predicted this in the past?Who announced it beforehand?Was it not I, the Lord?I have no peer, there is no God but me,a God who vindicates and delivers; there is none but me.
[poetry]

[22]
 Turn to me so you can be delivered, all you who live in the earth’s remote regions!For I am God, and I have no peer.
[poetry]

[23]
 I solemnly make this oath—what I say is true and reliable: ‘Surely every knee will bow to me,every tongue will solemnly affirm;
[poetry]

[poetry]

[25]
 All the descendants of Israel will be vindicated by the Lordand will boast in him.

Chapter 46
[poetry]

[46:1]
 Bel kneels down,Nebo bends low. Their images weigh down animals and beasts. Your heavy images are burdensome to tired animals.
[poetry]

[2]
 Together they bend low and kneel down;they are unable to rescue the images; they themselves head off into captivity.
[poetry]

[3]

 To whom can you compare and liken me?Tell me whom you think I resemble, so we can be compared!
[poetry]

[6]
 Those who empty out gold from a purseand weigh out silver on the scale hire a metalsmith, who makes it into a god.They then bow down and worship it.
[poetry]

[7]
 They put it on their shoulder and carry it;they put it in its place and it just stands there;it does not move from its place.Even when someone cries out to it, it does not reply;it does not deliver him from his distress.
[poetry]

[8]
 Remember this, so you can be brave. Think about it, you rebels!
[poetry]

[9]
 Remember what I accomplished in antiquity. Truly I am God, I have no peer; I am God, and there is none like me,
[poetry]

[10]
 who announces the end from the beginningand reveals beforehand what has not yet occurred;who says, ‘My plan will be realized,I will accomplish what I desire;’
[poetry]

[11]
 who summons an eagle from the east,from a distant land, one who carries out my plan.Yes, I have decreed, yes, I will bring it to pass;I have formulated a plan,yes, I will carry it out.
[poetry]

[12]
 Listen to me, you stubborn people, you who distance yourselves from doing what is right.
[poetry]

[13]
 I am bringing my deliverance near, it is not far away;I am bringing my salvation near, it does not wait.I will save Zion; I will adorn Israel with my splendor.

Chapter 47
[poetry]

[47:1]
 “Fall down! Sit in the dirt,O virgin daughter Babylon!Sit on the ground, not on a throne,O daughter of the Babylonians!Indeed, you will no longer be called delicate and pampered.
[poetry]

[2]
 Pick up millstones and grind flour.Remove your veil,strip off your skirt,expose your legs,cross the streams.
[poetry]

[3]
 Let your naked body be exposed.Your shame will be on display! I will get revenge;I will not have pity on anyone,”
[poetry]

[4]
 says our Protector—the Lord of Heaven’s Armies is his name,the Holy One of Israel.
[poetry]

[5]
 “Sit silently! Go to a hiding place, O daughter of the Babylonians!Indeed, you will no longer be called ‘Queen of kingdoms.’
[poetry]

[6]
 I was angry at my people;I defiled my special possessionand handed them over to you.You showed them no mercy; you even placed a very heavy burden on old people.
[poetry]

[7]
 You said,‘I will rule forever as permanent queen!’ You did not think about these things; you did not consider how it would turn out.
[poetry]

[8]
 So now, listen to this,O one who lives so lavishly, who lives securely,who says to herself, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me! I will never have to live as a widow;I will never lose my children.’
[poetry]

[9]
 Both of these will come upon yousuddenly, in one day!You will lose your children and be widowed. You will be overwhelmed by these tragedies, despite your many incantationsand your numerous amulets.
[poetry]

[10]
 You were complacent in your evil deeds; you thought, ‘No one sees me.’Your self-professed wisdom and knowledge lead you astray,when you say, ‘I am unique! No one can compare to me!’
[poetry]

[11]
 Disaster will overtake you;you will not know how to charm it away. Destruction will fall on you;you will not be able to appease it.Calamity will strike you suddenly,before you recognize it.
[poetry]

[12]
 Persist in trusting your amuletsand your many incantations,which you have faithfully recited since your youth!Maybe you will be successful—maybe you will scare away disaster.
[poetry]

[13]
 You are tired out from listening to so much advice. Let them take their stand—the ones who see omens in the sky,who gaze at the stars,who make monthly predictions—let them rescue you from the disaster that is about to overtake you!
[poetry]

[14]
 Look, they are like strawthat the fire burns up;they cannot rescue themselvesfrom the heat of the flames.There are no coals to warm them,no firelight to enjoy.
[poetry]

[15]
 They will disappoint you, those you have so faithfully dealt with since your youth. Each strays off in his own direction, leaving no one to rescue you.”

Chapter 48
[poetry]

[48:1]
 Listen to this, O family of Jacob, you who are called by the name “Israel,”and are descended from Judah, who take oaths in the name of the Lordand invoke the God of Israel—but not in an honest and just manner.
[poetry]

[2]
 Indeed, they live in the holy city; they trust in the God of Israel,whose name is the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.
[poetry]

[3]
 “I announced events beforehand, I issued the decrees and made the predictions; suddenly I acted and they came to pass.
[poetry]

[4]
 I did this because I know how stubborn you are.Your neck muscles are like ironand your forehead like bronze.
[poetry]

[5]
 I announced them to you beforehand;before they happened, I predicted them for you,so you could never say,‘My image did these things,my idol, my cast image, decreed them.’
[poetry]

[6]
 You have heard; now look at all the evidence! Will you not admit that what I say is true? From this point on I am announcing to you new eventsthat are previously unrevealed and you do not know about.
[poetry]

[7]
 Now they come into being, not in the past;before today you did not hear about them,so you could not say,‘Yes, I know about them.’
[poetry]

[8]
 You did not hear,you do not know,you were not told beforehand. For I know that you are very deceitful; you were labeled a rebel from birth.
[poetry]

[9]
 For the sake of my reputation I hold back my anger;for the sake of my prestige I restrain myself from destroying you.
[poetry]

[10]
 Look, I have refined you, but not as silver;I have purified you in the furnace of misery.
[poetry]

[11]
 For my sake alone I will act,for how can I allow my name to be defiled? I will not share my glory with anyone else!
[poetry]

[12]
 Listen to me, O Jacob,Israel, whom I summoned.I am the one;I am present at the very beginningand at the very end.
[poetry]

[13]
 Yes, my hand founded the earth;my right hand spread out the sky.I summon them;they stand together.
[poetry]

[14]
 All of you, gather together and listen!Who among them announced these things?The Lord’s ally will carry out his desire against Babylon;he will exert his power against the Babylonians.
[poetry]

[15]
 I, I have spoken—yes, I have summoned him;I lead him and he will succeed.
[poetry]

[16]
 Approach me—listen to this!From the very first I have not spoken in secret;when it happens, I am there.”So now, the Sovereign Lord has sent me, accompanied by his Spirit.
[poetry]

[17]
 This is what the Lord, your Protector, says,the Holy One of Israel: “I am the Lord your God,who teaches you how to succeed,who leads you in the way you should go.
[poetry]

[18]
 If only you had obeyed my commandments,prosperity would have flowed to you like a river, deliverance would have come to you like the waves of the sea.
[poetry]

[19]
 Your descendants would have been as numerous as sand and your children like its granules.Their name would not have been cut offand eliminated from my presence.
[poetry]

[20]
 Leave Babylon!Flee from the Babylonians!Announce it with a shout of joy!Make this known—proclaim it throughout the earth! Say, ‘The Lord protects his servant Jacob.
[poetry]

[21]
 They do not thirst as he leads them through dry regions;he makes water flow out of a rock for them;he splits open a rock and water flows out.’
[poetry]

[22]
 There will be no prosperity for the wicked,” says the Lord.

Chapter 49
[poetry]

[49:1]
 Listen to me, you coastlands! Pay attention, you people who live far away!The Lord summoned me from birth; he commissioned me when my mother brought me into the world.
[poetry]

[2]
 He made my mouth like a sharp sword,he hid me in the hollow of his hand;he made me like a sharpened arrow,he hid me in his quiver.
[poetry]

[3]
 He said to me, “You are my servant,Israel, through whom I will reveal my splendor.”
[poetry]

[4]
 But I thought, “I have worked in vain;I have expended my energy for absolutely nothing.” But the Lord will vindicate me;my God will reward me.
[poetry]

[5]
 So now the Lord says,the one who formed me from birth to be his servant—he did this to restore Jacob to himself,so that Israel might be gathered to him;and I will be honored in the Lord’s sight,for my God is my source of strength—
[poetry]

[6]
 he says, “Is it too insignificant a task for you to be my servant,to reestablish the tribes of Jacob,and restore the remnant of Israel? I will make you a light to the nations, so you can bring my deliverance to the remote regions of the earth.”
[poetry]

[7]
 This is what the Lord,the Protector of Israel, their Holy One, saysto the one who is despised and rejected by nations, a servant of rulers:“Kings will see and rise in respect, princes will bow down,because of the faithful Lord,the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
[poetry]

[8]
 This is what the Lord says:“At the time I decide to show my favor, I will respond to you;in the day of deliverance I will help you;I will protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people, to rebuild the land and to reassign the desolate property.
[poetry]

[9]
 You will say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’and to those who are in dark dungeons, ‘Emerge.’ They will graze beside the roads;on all the slopes they will find pasture.
[poetry]

[10]
 They will not be hungry or thirsty;the sun’s oppressive heat will not beat down on them, for one who has compassion on them will guide them;he will lead them to springs of water.
[poetry]

[11]
 I will make all my mountains into a road;I will construct my roadways.”
[poetry]

[12]
 Look, they come from far away!Look, some come from the north and west,and others from the land of Sinim.
[poetry]

[13]
 Shout for joy, O sky! Rejoice, O earth!Let the mountains give a joyful shout!For the Lord consoles his peopleand shows compassion to the oppressed.
[poetry]

[14]
 “Zion said, ‘The Lord has abandoned me,the Lord has forgotten me.’
[poetry]

[15]

[poetry]

[16]
 Look, I have inscribed your name on my palms;your walls are constantly before me.
[poetry]

[17]
 Your children hurry back,while those who destroyed and devastated you depart.
[poetry]

[18]
 Look all around you! All of them gather to you.As surely as I live,” says the Lord,“you will certainly wear all of them like jewelry;you will put them on as if you were a bride.
[poetry]

[19]
 Yes, your land lies in ruins;it is desolate and devastated. But now you will be too small to hold your residents,and those who devoured you will be far away.
[poetry]

[20]
 Yet the children born during your time of bereavementwill say within your hearing,‘This place is too cramped for us, make room for us so we can live here.’
[poetry]

[21]
 Then you will think to yourself, ‘Who bore these children for me?I was bereaved and barren,dismissed and divorced. Who raised these children?Look, I was left all alone;where did these children come from?’”
[poetry]

[22]
 This is what the Sovereign Lord says:“Look I will raise my hand to the nations;I will raise my signal flag to the peoples.They will bring your sons in their armsand carry your daughters on their shoulders.
[poetry]

[23]
 Kings will be your children’s guardians;their princesses will nurse your children. With their faces to the ground they will bow down to you,and they will lick the dirt on your feet.Then you will recognize that I am the Lord;those who wait patiently for me are not put to shame.
[poetry]

[24]
 Can spoils be taken from a warrior,or captives be rescued from a conqueror?
[poetry]

[25]
 Indeed,” says the Lord,“captives will be taken from a warrior;spoils will be rescued from a conqueror.I will oppose your adversaryand I will rescue your children.
[poetry]

[26]

[50:1]
 This is what the Lord says:“Where is your mother’s divorce certificateby which I divorced her?Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Look, you were sold because of your sins; because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.
[poetry]

[2]
 Why does no one challenge me when I come?Why does no one respond when I call? Is my hand too weak to deliver you?Do I lack the power to rescue you?Look, with a mere shout I can dry up the sea;I can turn streams into a desert,so the fish rot away and die from lack of water.
[poetry]

[3]
 I can clothe the sky in darkness;I can cover it with sackcloth.”
[poetry]

[4]
 The Sovereign Lord has given me the capacity to be his spokesman, so that I know how to help the weary. He wakes me up every morning;he makes me alert so I can listen attentively as disciples do.
[poetry]

[5]
 The Sovereign Lord has spoken to me clearly; I have not rebelled,I have not turned back.
[poetry]

[6]
 I offered my back to those who attacked, my jaws to those who tore out my beard;I did not hide my facefrom insults and spitting.
[poetry]

[7]
 But the Sovereign Lord helps me,so I am not humiliated.For that reason I am steadfastly resolved; I know I will not be put to shame.
[poetry]

[8]
 The one who vindicates me is close by.Who dares to argue with me? Let us confront each other! Who is my accuser? Let him challenge me!
[poetry]

[9]
 Look, the Sovereign Lord helps me.Who dares to condemn me?Look, all of them will wear out like clothes;a moth will eat away at them.
[poetry]

[10]
 Who among you fears the Lord?Who obeys his servant?Whoever walks in deep darkness, without light,should trust in the name of the Lordand rely on his God.
[poetry]

[11]
 Look, all of you who start a fireand who equip yourselves with flaming arrows, walk in the light of the fire you startedand among the flaming arrows you ignited! This is what you will receive from me: You will lie down in a place of pain.

[poetry]

[4]
 Pay attention to me, my people.Listen to me, my people!For I will issue a decree, I will make my justice a light to the nations.
[poetry]

[5]
 I am ready to vindicate, I am ready to deliver, I will establish justice among the nations. The coastlands wait patiently for me;they wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power.
[poetry]

[6]
 Look up at the sky.Look at the earth below.For the sky will dissipate like smoke,and the earth will wear out like clothes;its residents will die like gnats.But the deliverance I give is permanent;the vindication I provide will not disappear.
[poetry]

[7]
 Listen to me, you who know what is right,you people who are aware of my law. Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;don’t be discouraged because of their abuse.
[poetry]

[8]
 For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;a clothes moth will devour them like wool.But the vindication I provide will be permanent;the deliverance I give will last.”
[poetry]

 Wake up! Wake up!Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord! Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity.Did you not smash the Proud One? Did you not wound the sea monster?
[poetry]

[10]
 Did you not dry up the sea,the waters of the great deep?Did you not make a path through the depths of the sea,so those delivered from bondage could cross over?
[poetry]

 Those whom the Lord has ransomed will return;they will enter Zion with a happy shout.Unending joy will crown them, happiness and joy will overwhelm them;grief and suffering will disappear.
[poetry]

[12]

 There was no one to lead heramong all the children she bore;there was no one to take her by the handamong all the children she raised.
[poetry]

[19]
 These double disasters confronted you.But who feels sorry for you?Destruction and devastation,famine and sword.But who consoles you?
[poetry]

[20]
 Your children faint;they lie at the head of every streetlike an antelope in a snare.They are left in a stupor by the Lord’s anger,by the battle cry of your God.
[poetry]

[21]
 So listen to this, oppressed one,who is drunk, but not from wine.
[poetry]

[22]
 This is what your Sovereign Lord, even your God who judges his people says:“Look, I have removed from your handthe cup of intoxicating wine, the goblet full of my anger. You will no longer have to drink it.
[poetry]

[23]
 I will put it into the hand of your tormentors who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’You made your back like the groundand like the street for those who walked over you.”

[poetry]

[4]
 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says:“In the beginning my people went to live temporarily in Egypt;Assyria oppressed them for no good reason.
[poetry]

[5]
 And now, what do we have here?” says the Lord.“Indeed my people have been carried away for nothing,those who rule over them taunt,” says the Lord, “and my name is constantly slandered all day long.
[poetry]

[6]
 For this reason my people will know my name;for this reason they will know at that time that I am the one who says,‘Here I am.’”
[poetry]

[7]
 How delightful it is to see approaching over the mountains the feet of a messenger who announces peace,a messenger who brings good news, who announces deliverance,who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”

[8]
 Listen, your watchmen shout;in unison they shout for joy,for they see with their very own eyes the Lord’s return to Zion.

 Yet do not depart quicklyor leave in a panic. For the Lord goes before you;the God of Israel is your rear guard.
[poetry]

[13]
 Look, my servant will succeed! He will be elevated, lifted high, and greatly exalted—
[poetry]

[14]
 (just as many were horrified by the sight of you) he was so disfigured he no longer looked like a man;his form was so marred he no longer looked human—
[poetry]

[15]
 so now he will startle many nations.Kings will be shocked by his exaltation, for they will witness something unannounced to them,and they will understand something they had not heard about.

Chapter 53
[poetry]

[53:1]
 Who would have believed what we just heard? When was the Lord’s power revealed through him?
[poetry]

[2]
 He sprouted up like a twig before God, like a root out of parched soil; he had no stately form or majesty that might catch our attention, no special appearance that we should want to follow him.
[poetry]

[3]
 He was despised and rejected by people, one who experienced pain and was acquainted with illness;people hid their faces from him; he was despised, and we considered him insignificant.
[poetry]

[4]
 But he lifted up our illnesses,he carried our pain; even though we thought he was being punished,attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.
[poetry]

[5]
 He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,crushed because of our sins;he endured punishment that made us well; because of his wounds we have been healed.
[poetry]

[6]
 All of us had wandered off like sheep;each of us had strayed off on his own path,but the Lord caused the sin of all of us to attack him.
[poetry]

[7]
 He was treated harshly and afflicted, but he did not even open his mouth.Like a lamb led to the slaughtering block,like a sheep silent before her shearers,he did not even open his mouth.
[poetry]

[8]
 He was led away after an unjust trial—but who even cared? Indeed, he was cut off from the land of the living; because of the rebellion of his own people he was wounded.
[poetry]

[9]
 They intended to bury him with criminals, but he ended up in a rich man’s tomb because he had committed no violent deeds,nor had he spoken deceitfully.
[poetry]

[10]
 Though the Lord desired to crush him and make him ill,once restitution is made, he will see descendants and enjoy long life, and the Lord’s purpose will be accomplished through him.
[poetry]

[11]
 Having suffered, he will reflect on his work,he will be satisfied when he understands what he has done. “My servant will acquit many, for he carried their sins.
[poetry]

[12]
 So I will assign him a portion with the multitudes, he will divide the spoils of victory with the powerful, because he willingly submitted to deathand was numbered with the rebels,when he lifted up the sin of manyand intervened on behalf of the rebels.”

Chapter 54
[poetry]

[54:1]
 “Shout for joy, O barren one who has not given birth!Give a joyful shout and cry out, you who have not been in labor!For the children of the desolate one are more numerousthan the children of the married woman,” says the Lord.
[poetry]

[2]
 Make your tent larger,stretch your tent curtains farther out! Spare no effort,lengthen your ropes,and pound your stakes deep.
[poetry]

[3]
 For you will spread out to the right and to the left;your children will conquer nationsand will resettle desolate cities.
[poetry]

[4]

[poetry]

[8]

[poetry]

[9]
 “As far as I am concerned, this is like in Noah’s time, when I vowed that the waters of Noah’s flood would never again cover the earth.In the same way I have vowed that I will not be angry at you or shout at you.
[poetry]

 Even if the mountains are removedand the hills displaced,my devotion will not be removed from you,nor will my covenant of friendship be displaced,”says the Lord, the one who has compassion on you.

 If anyone dares to challenge you, it will not be my doing!Whoever tries to challenge you will be defeated.
[poetry]

 No weapon forged to be used against you will succeed;you will refute everyone who tries to accuse you. This is what the Lord will do for his servants—I will vindicate them,” says the Lord.

Chapter 55
[poetry]

[55:1]
 “Hey, all who are thirsty, come to the water!You who have no money, come! Buy and eat!Come! Buy wine and milkwithout money and without cost.
[poetry]

[2]
 Why pay money for something that will not nourish you? Why spend your hard-earned money on something that will not satisfy?Listen carefully to me and eat what is nourishing! Enjoy fine food.
[poetry]

[3]
 Pay attention and come to me.Listen, so you can live. Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you,just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David.
[poetry]

[4]
 Look, I made him a witness to nations, a ruler and commander of nations.”
[poetry]

[5]
 Look, you will summon nations you did not previously know;nations that did not previously know you will run to you,because of the Lord your God,the Holy One of Israel, for he bestows honor on you.
[poetry]

[6]
