Nahum Text

Chapter 1
[bodytext]
[1:1]
 This is an oracle about Nineveh; the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
[poetry]
[2]
 The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;the Lord is avenging and very angry. The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;he sustains his rage against his enemies.
[poetry]
[3]
 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power; the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm; dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet.
[poetry]
[4]
 He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up; he makes all the rivers run dry.Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon withers.
[poetry]
[5]
 The mountains tremble before him; the hills convulse; the earth is laid waste before him;the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste.
[poetry]
[6]
 No one can withstand his indignation! No one can resist his fierce anger! His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire,boulders are broken up as he approaches.
[poetry]
[7]
 The Lord is good—indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, and he protects those who seek refuge in him.
[poetry]
[8]
 But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of Nineveh; he will drive his enemies into darkness.
[poetry]
[9]
 Whatever you plot against the Lord, he will completely destroy! Distress will not arise a second time.
[poetry]
[10]
 Surely they will be totally consumed like entangled thornbushes, like the drink of drunkards, like very dry stubble.
[poetry]
[11]
 From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the Lord,a wicked military strategist.
[poetry]
[12]
 This is what the Lord says: “Even though they are powerful—and what is more, even though their army is numerous—nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away! Although I afflicted you,I will afflict you no more.
[poetry]
[13]
 And now, I will break Assyria’s yoke bar from your neck; I will tear apart the shackles that are on you.”
[poetry]
[14]
 The Lord has issued a decree against you: “Your dynasty will come to an end. I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods.I will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!”
[poetry]
[15]
 (2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains!A messenger is proclaiming deliverance: “Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah!Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God! For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you;they have been completely destroyed.”

Chapter 2
[poetry]
[2:1]
 (2:2) An enemy who will scatter you, Nineveh, has advanced against you! Guard the rampart! Watch the road!Prepare yourselves for battle! Muster your mighty strength!
[poetry]
[2]
 For the Lord is about to restore the majesty of Jacob,as well as the majesty of Israel,though their enemies have plundered them and have destroyed their fields.
[poetry]
[3]
 The shields of his warriors are dyed red; the mighty soldiers are dressed in scarlet garments. The chariots are in flashing metal fittings on the day of battle; the soldiers brandish their spears.
[poetry]
[4]
 The chariots race madly through the streets,they rush back and forth in the broad plazas;they look like lightning bolts, they dash here and there like flashes of lightning.
[poetry]
[5]
 The commander orders his officers;they stumble as they advance; they rush to the city wall, and they set up the covered siege tower.
[poetry]
[6]
 The sluice gates are opened;the royal palace is deluged and dissolves.
[poetry]
[7]
 Nineveh is taken into exile and is led away; her slave girls moan like doves while they beat their breasts.
[poetry]
[8]
 Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days, but now her people are running away; she cries out: “Stop! Stop!”—but no one turns back.
[poetry]
[9]
 Her conquerors cry out: “Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”There is no end to the treasure—riches of every kind of precious thing.
[poetry]
[10]
 Destruction, devastation, and desolation! Hearts faint, knees tremble;every stomach churns, all their faces have turned pale!
[poetry]
[11]
 Where now is the den of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions,where the lion, lioness, and lion cub once prowled and no one disturbed them?
[poetry]
[12]
 The lion tore apart as much prey as his cubs neededand strangled prey for his lionesses;he filled his lairs with preyand his dens with torn flesh.
[poetry]
[13]
 “I am against you!” declares the Lord of Heaven’s Armies: “I will burn your chariots with fire; the sword will devour your young lions. You will no longer prey upon the land; the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”

Chapter 3
[poetry]
[3:1]
 Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed! She is full of lies; she is filled with plunder; she has hoarded her spoil!
[poetry]
[2]
 The chariot drivers will crack their whips; the chariot wheels will shake the ground. The chariot horses will gallop; the war chariots will bolt forward!
[poetry]
[3]
 The charioteers will charge ahead; their swords will flash and their spears will glimmer! There will be many people slain; there will be piles of the deadand countless casualties—so many that people will stumble over the corpses.
[poetry]
[4]
 Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute—a seductive mistress who practices sorcery, who enslaves nations by her harlotry, and entices peoples by her sorcery—
[poetry]
[5]
 “I am against you,” declares the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. “I will strip off your clothes! I will show your nakedness to the nationsand your shame to the kingdoms.
[poetry]
[6]
 I will pelt you with filth; I will treat you with contempt;I will make you a public spectacle.
[poetry]
[7]
 Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust;they will say, ‘Nineveh has been devastated!Who will lament for her?’There will be no one to comfort you!”
[poetry]
[8]
 You are no more secure than Thebes—she was located on the banks of the Nile;the waters surrounded her—her rampart was the sea,the water was her wall.
[poetry]
[9]
 Cush and Egypt had limitless strength; Put and the Libyans were among her allies.
[poetry]
[10]
 Yet she went into captivity as an exile; even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street.They cast lots for her nobility; all her dignitaries were bound with chains.
[poetry]
[11]
 You too will act like drunkards; you will go into hiding; you too will seek refuge from the enemy.
[poetry]
[12]
 All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit: If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater.
[poetry]
[13]
 Your warriors will be like women in your midst;the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies;fire will consume the bars of your gates.
[poetry]
[14]
 Draw yourselves water for a siege! Strengthen your fortifications!Trample the mud and tread the clay!Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls!
[poetry]
[15]
 There the fire will consume you;the sword will cut you down;it will devour you like the young locust would.Multiply yourself like the young locust;multiply yourself like the flying locust!
[poetry]
[16]
 Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven!They are like the young locust that sheds its skin and flies away.
[poetry]
[17]
 Your courtiers are like locusts,your officials are like a swarm of locusts!They encamp in the walls on a cold day,yet when the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where they are.
[poetry]
[18]
 Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria.Your officers are slumbering! Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains,and there is no one to regather them.
[poetry]
[19]
 Your destruction is like an incurable wound; your demise is like a fatal injury. All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy, for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!
