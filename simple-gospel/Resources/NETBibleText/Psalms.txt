 When they were few in number,just a very few, and resident foreigners within it,

[15]
 saying, “Don’t touch my chosen ones.Don’t harm my prophets.”
[poetry]

[16]
 He called down a famine upon the earth;he cut off all the food supply.

[38]
 Egypt was happy when they left,for they were afraid of them.
[poetry]

[39]
 He spread out a cloud for a cover, and provided a fire to light up the night.
[poetry]

 They asked for food, and he sent quail;he satisfied them with food from the sky.

[poetry]

[5]
 so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones,rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people who belong to you.
[poetry]

[6]
 We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil.
[poetry]

[7]
 Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds.They failed to remember your many acts of loyal love,and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
[poetry]

[8]
 Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation that he might reveal his power.
[poetry]

[9]
 He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up;he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
[poetry]

[10]
 He delivered them from the power of the one who hated themand rescued them from the power of the enemy.
[poetry]

[11]
 The water covered their enemies;not even one of them survived.
[poetry]

[12]
 They believed his promises; they sang praises to him.
[poetry]

[13]
 They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions.
[poetry]

[14]
 In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the wastelands.
[poetry]

[15]
 He granted their request,then struck them with a disease.
[poetry]

[16]
 In the camp they resented Mosesand Aaron the Lord’s holy priest.
[poetry]

[17]
 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;it engulfed the group led by Abiram.

[18]
 Fire burned their group;the flames scorched the wicked.
[poetry]

[19]
 They made an image of a calf at Horeband worshiped a metal idol.
[poetry]

[20]
 They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
[poetry]

[21]
 They rejected the God who delivered them,the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
[poetry]

[22]
 amazing feats in the land of Ham,mighty acts by the Red Sea.
[poetry]

[23]
 He threatened to destroy them,but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger.
[poetry]

[24]
 They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise.
[poetry]

[25]
 They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the Lord.
[poetry]

[26]
 So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the wilderness,
[poetry]

[27]
 make their descendants die among the nations,and scatter them among foreign lands.
[poetry]

[28]
 They worshiped Baal of Peorand ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
[poetry]

[29]
 They made the Lord angry by their actions,and a plague broke out among them.
[poetry]

[30]
 Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided.
[poetry]

[31]
 This was credited to Phinehas as a righteous actfor all generations to come.
[poetry]

[32]
 They made him angry by the waters of Meribah,and Moses suffered because of them,
[poetry]

[33]
 for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly.
[poetry]

[34]
 They did not destroy the nations, as the Lord had commanded them to do.
[poetry]

[35]
 They mixed in with the nationsand learned their ways.
[poetry]

[36]
 They worshiped their idols,which became a snare to them.
[poetry]

[37]
 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
[poetry]

[38]
 They shed innocent blood—the blood of their sons and daughters,whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.The land was polluted by bloodshed.
[poetry]

[39]
 They were defiled by their deedsand unfaithful in their actions.
[poetry]

[40]
 So the Lord was angry with his people and despised the people who belonged to him.
[poetry]

[41]
 He handed them over to the nations,and those who hated them ruled over them.
[poetry]

[42]
 Their enemies oppressed them;they were subject to their authority.
[poetry]

[43]
 Many times he delivered them,but they had a rebellious attitude and degraded themselves by their sin.
[poetry]

[44]
 Yet he took notice of their distress,when he heard their cry for help.
[poetry]

[45]
 He remembered his covenant with themand relented because of his great loyal love.
[poetry]

[46]
 He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them.
[poetry]

[47]
 Deliver us, O Lord, our God.Gather us from among the nations.Then we will give thanks to your holy name,and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.

[poetry]

[5]
 They were hungry and thirsty;they fainted from exhaustion.
[poetry]

 They cried out to the Lord in their distress;he delivered them from their troubles.
[poetry]

 He led them on a level road that they might find a city in which to live.
[poetry]

[8]
 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal loveand for the amazing things he has done for people.
[poetry]

[9]
 For he has satisfied those who thirst, and those who hunger he has filled with food.
[poetry]

[10]
 They sat in utter darkness, bound in painful iron chains
[poetry]

[11]
 because they had rebelled against God’s commands and rejected the instructions of the Most High.
[poetry]

[12]
 So he used suffering to humble them; they stumbled and no one helped them up.
[poetry]

 He brought them out of the utter darkness and tore off their shackles.

[poetry]

[18]

  Some traveled on the sea in shipsand carried cargo over the vast waters.
[poetry]

[24]
 They witnessed the acts of the Lord,his amazing feats on the deep water.
[poetry]

[25]
 He gave the order for a windstorm, and it stirred up the waves of the sea.
[poetry]

[26]
 They reached up to the sky,then dropped into the depths.The sailors’ strength left them because the danger was so great.
[poetry]

[27]
 They swayed and staggered like drunks,and all their skill proved ineffective.
[poetry]

[28]
 They cried out to the Lord in their distress;he delivered them from their troubles.
[poetry]

[29]
 He calmed the storm, and the waves grew silent.
[poetry]

[poetry]

[33]
 He turned streams into a desert,springs of water into arid land,
[poetry]

[34]
 and a fruitful land into a barren place, because of the sin of its inhabitants.
[poetry]

[35]
 As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of waterand a dry land into springs of water.
[poetry]

[36]
 He allowed the hungry to settle there,and they established a city in which to live.
[poetry]

[37]
 They cultivated fieldsand planted vineyards,which yielded a harvest of fruit.
[poetry]

[38]
 He blessed them so that they became very numerous.He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.
[poetry]

[39]
 As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down,because of painful distress and suffering.
[poetry]

[40]
 He would pour contempt upon princes,and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.
[poetry]

[41]
 Yet he protected the needy from oppressionand cared for his families like a flock of sheep.
[poetry]

[42]
 When the godly see this, they rejoice,and every sinner shuts his mouth.

 Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things.Let them consider the Lord’s acts of loyal love.

[14]
 May his ancestors’ sins be remembered by the Lord.May his mother’s sin not be forgotten.
[poetry]

[15]
 May the Lord be constantly aware of them and cut off the memory of his children from the earth.
[poetry]

[16]
 For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needyand killed the disheartened.
[poetry]

[17]
 He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him. He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings.
[poetry]

[18]
 He made cursing a way of life, so curses poured into his stomach like waterand seeped into his bones like oil.
